<entry name="GRIMM_DEFEAT_2">Look here! How our child has grown, nourished and strengthened by the heat of our passionate dance!&lt;page&gt;The two of you will feature in many tragedies and triumphs together, I&#39;m sure.&lt;page&gt;And so our great Ritual nears its end. Will you continue to harvest the flame, even though now you surely see the path it illuminates for us?&lt;page&gt;Our scarlet eyes will watch you keenly... friend.</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_GRIMM">Have you seen them? The travellers who set up camp outside of town?&lt;page&gt;I was interested at first, not a lot has been happening lately. But they have a... sinister feeling to them. You can feel it, right?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve told Cornifer he&#39;s not to speak to them. His heart and his mind are a little too open sometimes.</entry>
<entry name="BRUMM_DREAM_DEEPNEST">Yes. We are merely vessels for the flame. But... were we always empty?</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_RITUAL_COMPLETE">Across these lands my kin now spread, harvesting that essence peculiar to my... breed, the flame in dream.&lt;page&gt;Seek my kin; claim their flame and return it to me. Together, marvels shall be achieved.&lt;page&gt;But don&#39;t fret small one. For this task you won&#39;t travel alone. My child shall guide you to the flame and gather within itself that burning essence.&lt;page&gt;Like you, the child plays key role in this task. Only with it by your side will the flame, and my kin, reveal themselves to you.</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_NYMM">A stylish fellow&#39;s made his way to town. Normally I&#39;m wary of musicians, all pomp and ego.&lt;page&gt;This one seems okay... and he&#39;s not asked for any Geo just yet. Let&#39;s hope it stays that way.</entry>
<entry name="BRUMM_DEEPNEST_3">So we serve... Thus it has ever been. Yes?&lt;page&gt;Take the flame then, it is why you came here.</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_OFFER_2">Again...? You&#39;re so greedy for gifts! Poor little lovely. Give me your Geo, and I will give you your gift.</entry>
<entry name="IGOR_MEET">Mrmm. You called us?&lt;page&gt;Speak to Master.</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_RECEIVED_GIFT">You like it very much, don&#39;t you? Your gift. You&#39;re lucky to carry such a smell with you!&lt;page&gt;Eeeuuaaarrrrggh!</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_GRIMMCHILD_FULL">Your companion&#39;s eyes burn with a familiar flame... Success then for the scarlet heart, and irony, to use my spawn to grow its own.&lt;page&gt;I know you creature, and the form time shall bring. You may be all and one, clan and master, but this land shall never bear so foreign a king.</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_DREAM_LEGEATER">The most exquisite things I&#39;ve ever experienced! Ahhhhh!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ll take them with me... precious, precious memories of you! Precious tastes and smells!</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_EAT">Aaaahhhhhhhhhhhh! So good! So tasty! A perfect, perfect thing, just for me! Ahhhhhh!</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_NOTENOUGH">No Geo... why? Why don&#39;t you have enough Geo?</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_DIARY_LEAVE">                          The Maiden&#39;s Quest&lt;br&gt;Her Grey Prince diminished and her White Saviour revealed as beast, the Maiden at last understood the truth.&lt;page&gt;Her life&#39;s companion would not appear, for they could not appear to a maiden sat idle. She must instead seek them out, must find her love, and free them of their solitude.&lt;page&gt;And thus her own journey began, out into dangerous lands, shielded by her love awaiting, guided by her love to be.&lt;page&gt;With every step, the maiden could feel it, their fated meeting, coming ever closer. </entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_GIVE">Ahhhhhhhhhh! Ahhhh!&lt;page&gt;Such a little beauty! Such a smell... such a smell! Ahhh!</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_DREAM">Masterful! Even a vessel discarded bears fierce strength.&lt;page&gt;Fine craft dear Wyrm, and perfect tool to prolong the heart of Grimm.</entry>
<entry name="NYMM_REPEAT">My dear friend, are you enjoying my music? It&#39;s as upbeat a tune as I know, but I must admit, even it falls a little on the sadder side.&lt;page&gt;Please know I play it with joy. Being in this town, beside such good company as yourself, I feel remarkably, refreshingly content.</entry>
<entry name="BRUMM_LANTERN">So you followed me here, to where the Ritual began. You would join me in breaking it then?&lt;page&gt;It is painful to defy the Master, but our harvest... it profanes this dark, quiet Kingdom. This once, I would see the Ritual fail.&lt;page&gt;Mrmm.. Now! Let us destroy the anchor, and banish the Master. Never shall he return here again!</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_DEFEAT_1">Bravo, my friend. Hear how the crowd adores you! They&#39;ve not seen such a show in a long time.</entry>
<entry name="IGOR_FLAME">The flame. Seek it out.&lt;page&gt;For Master. For our kin. Mrmm.</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_DEFEAT_3">Go out into the darkness. Harvest the last lingering embers of this Kingdom. Then return to me and we will complete our dance.</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_MEET">Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!&lt;page&gt;Did you call us? You called us, and we came. We came!&lt;page&gt;You don&#39;t look scared. Why did you call us?&lt;page&gt;Ahhh. It doesn&#39;t matter. Don&#39;t tell me.&lt;page&gt;We came, and I can smell something. Something deep below us. I want it... I want it!</entry>
<entry name="PROMPT_FRAGILE_STRENGTH">Give Fragile Strength charm?</entry>
<entry name="PROMPT_FRAGILE_HEART">Give Fragile Heart charm?</entry>
<entry name="GRIMMSTEED_DREAM_1">A new land. Different from the last. How many more will we see?</entry>
<entry name="GRIMMSTEED_DREAM_2">The roads between are dark and long, but the Master&#39;s light will always guide us.</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_BATTLE_1">Wonderful. Wonderful! My kin arrive and the time has come.</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_BATTLE_2">This searing fire... It carries well the Ritual&#39;s promise.</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_BATTLE_3">Dance with me, my friend. The crowd awaits. Show them you are worthy of a starring role!</entry>
<entry name="BRUMM_REMINDER">You wish to see the Master? Return with the child full of flame and he shall appear.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_BRETTA_LEAVE">That young lass! Why, she&#39;s up and departed over the cliffs, with only the briefest word of farewell.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a perilous journey she&#39;s set herself upon. I can&#39;t understand where she gained such fortitude.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d thought her a timid sort, one after my own mind... How wrong I was. The call of adventure lures all but me!</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_EATEN">Beautiful, delicious... Ahhhhhh!&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re good, little lovely. You&#39;re very sweet, to bring me such a gift!</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_EATEN2">The one who made my gift... Aahhh, somewhere below? Yes?&lt;page&gt;Very good gift. Very tasty! Delicious!</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_EATEN3">Do you want something, little lovely? You don&#39;t want to take my gift back, do you?&lt;page&gt;Eeuuarrggh! So nasty, so cruel, if that&#39;s true! Once you give something as a gift it&#39;s lost to you forever!</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_EATEN4">A gift? For you? So greedy!&lt;page&gt;But... I can show you something if you&#39;re nice to me, little lovely. Will you do a nice thing, lovely?&lt;page&gt;Give them to me... your Geo. Give me your Geo and I&#39;ll give you a gift.</entry>
<entry name="LEG_EATER_GOLD_REPEAT">I know where you are now. Above me. Much above me, but I know where to go. I will come! Don&#39;t try to hide from me!</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_GIFT_REFUSE">Eeuuarrggh! Refuse me, then!</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_ACCEPT">As the lantern flared your role was cast, our compact written in scarlet fire.&lt;page&gt;Eager we are to see you commence, but first, some illumination is required.</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_GRIMMCHILD">Ahh, that creature beside. It would be naive to claim it friend, though you two share a... similarity? It is a distant link, one words would strain to convey.&lt;page&gt;For it to cling to you now... You&#39;ve been consumed in the Ritual of that scarlet clan.&lt;page&gt;In what poor moment they descend upon our ruin. Aid their propagation, if you so choose, but do not renege on the larger task this kingdom implores.</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_DREAM">Shadow and fire will dance together so prettily, I think...</entry>
<entry name="SLY_GRIMM">I&#39;ve been hearing about the strangers that have come to town. They&#39;re strange indeed from what&#39;s been told.&lt;page&gt;What interest does this tired little place hold for them? I&#39;m thinking you may know the answer to that.&lt;page&gt;None of my business of course, but I&#39;d be wary of their deals and promises. Keep your nail half-drawn, if you understand me.</entry>
<entry name="NYMM_BRUMM_CHARM">Ahh. Just marvelous! I&#39;m so glad you&#39;d consider my gift worth wearing, and my, my, it does suit you well.&lt;page&gt;To be honest, I&#39;m not even sure where I came upon it, but staring at its design, my memory stirs, something, and someone, forgotten, lost far away.&lt;page&gt;The specifics elude me, but a strange sense remains, fear, but also... longing? Like a strange nostalgia for something that never happened.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve no need for it in any case, so I&#39;m glad you&#39;re enjoying it.</entry>
<entry name="IGOR_FINAL">...Mrmm.&lt;page&gt;Very good. The child burns with flame.&lt;page&gt;Master... is waiting for you. Mrmm.</entry>
<entry name="PROMPT_FRAGILE_GREED">Give Fragile Greed charm?</entry>
<entry name="NYMM_FINAL">Dear friend, I heard a violent scream from below. Even my song could not mask such a horrible shriek. Was it pain, or rage? I find I&#39;m rather sensitive to such things.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;re planning to head down, please do stay safe. I&#39;d be dreadfully upset if I forever lost your company.</entry>
<entry name="NYMM_DREAM">Hmm...Why did I choose to travel here? And how far must I have come... to forget the origin entirely.</entry>
<entry name="BRUMM_DEEPNEST_NF_1">Mrmm. You came.&lt;page&gt;You have gathered the flame and so the time for the ritual&#39;s completion is upon us. All you must do now is return to the Master...&lt;page&gt;Thus it goes, as it ever has. We are like the notes in an old, old song. You and me. Mrmm.&lt;page&gt;And yet... It is not merely by fortune that we meet here, in the darkest, furthest reaches of the world, where my Master&#39;s scarlet eyes can not see us.&lt;page&gt;Mrmm. A song that never ends... is no song at all.&lt;page&gt;You take part in the Ritual, yet I sense you truly have no Master. Is it so? Perhaps together we can banish that livid flame and let this dead Kingdom rest in peace.&lt;page&gt;If you wish to silence the endless song... Mrmm, meet me where it began... </entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_GRIMM_DREAM">Why must these grotesque strangers intrude on our peaceful little home? Sometimes it feels like the whole world is conspiring to make me uncomfortable.</entry>
<entry name="UI_CHARM_LOST">Charm Lost</entry>
<entry name="PROMPT_DIVINE_GIFT">Pay to get a gift?</entry>
<entry name="BRUMM_DEEPNEST_1">Mrmm. You came.&lt;page&gt;The red flame I&#39;ve gathered from this dead Kingdom. You would claim it... for our Master. For his final act.&lt;page&gt;The Ritual plays itself out once more. We are like the notes in an old, old song. You and me. Mrmm.</entry>
<entry name="BRUMM_DEEPNEST_2">Endless, repeating songs of sacrifice, of servitude. For the Ritual. For the troupe. For the Master.&lt;page&gt;Even this child was born into invisible chains. Mrmm.</entry>
<entry name="GRIMMSYCOPHANT_INSPECT">The corpse of a large bug.</entry>
<entry name="BRUMM_DEEPNEST_4">It is done... and yet...&lt;page&gt;It is not merely by fortune that we meet here, in the darkest, furthest reaches of the world, where my Master&#39;s scarlet eyes can not see us.&lt;page&gt;Mrmm. A song that never ends... is no song at all.&lt;page&gt;You take part in the Ritual, yet I sense you truly have no Master. Is it so? Perhaps together we can banish that livid flame and let this dead Kingdom rest in peace.&lt;page&gt;If you wish to silence the endless song... Mrmm, meet me where it began.&lt;page&gt;But if you return to the Master and complete the Ritual... Mrmm. As long as you do it without regret, I will bear you no hatred.</entry>
<entry name="IGOR_SPEAK">...Mrmm.&lt;page&gt;Speak to Master.</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_REOFFER">You want a gift. Greedy! Give me Geo and you will get a gift...</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_CHARM_EQUIPPED_2">Aaaaahhhhhhh! I can smell it! Another gift, made for me. Give it to me!</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_LEVELUP_1">I can feel it. The warmth of the flame you&#39;ve gathered together.</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_LEVELUP_2">A masterful opening act. The air hums with excitement.&lt;page&gt;Dear child, you&#39;ve done so well. Let your fire burn even brighter!</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_LEVELUP_3">Beautiful, yes. The child has grown, from idle youth to deadly companion. About these dangerous lands, its aid will no doubt be welcome.&lt;page&gt; Just don&#39;t neglect our dance, for it too continues! Keep hunting that scattered, scarlet essence.&lt;page&gt;When the child is filled with flame once more, return to the stage and the performance will begin. </entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_FINAL_REPEAT">That&#39;s enough. Enough! I&#39;m feeling very happy now.&lt;page&gt;Aaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Now, I can follow Master...</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_GRIMM_DEPARTED">Ahhh! Then the Ritual is complete? And the Master has... moved on? Has he? Perhaps, not?&lt;page&gt;Ahhh, but more for me. Still more I can do. Gifts, so lovely! Aaaahh. Master would understand.</entry>
<entry name="MIDWIFE_WEAVERSONG_DREAM">Just because you&#39;re suddenly rich with threaded friends, don&#39;t think you&#39;re welcome in my mind! Out! Out! Out!</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_HAS_CHARM">That smell! Eeuuarrggh! You&#39;re hiding something very nice from me, aren&#39;t you? Shouldn&#39;t hide something so nice!&lt;page&gt;Show me... show me! Put it on! Quickly!</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_MZOTE_01">Grey Prince? Your words, are they... repeating? </entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_MZOTE_02">Grey Prince? You seem... smaller? Were you always so tattered and stained...?</entry>
<entry name="PLAQUE_WARN">To witness secrets sealed, one must endure the harshest punishment.</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_FINAL">One final gift! Ahhhhhhhh!&lt;page&gt;I liked it very much. Very, very good. So good!&lt;page&gt;Eaaauuurrgggh!! Eaauurggh! Now, I can follow Master...</entry>
<entry name="BRUMM_DEEPNEST_REPEAT">If you wish to silence this endless song, meet me where it began...&lt;page&gt;But if you wish to continue the Ritual... Mrmm. As long as you do it without regret, I will bear you no hatred.</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_CHARM_EQUIPPED">Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!&lt;page&gt;That charm... beautiful! Most precious thing! Little lovely, will you let me see it? Have to show it to me! </entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_CONVO_1">You carry a lot of smells on you, but you don&#39;t have one of your own. Funny little thing...</entry>
<entry name="SLY_NYMM">Another bug&#39;s arrived. And quite a racket he&#39;s making in the square. Worse, he&#39;s not a Geo to his name! Only that blasted, squealing instrument.&lt;page&gt;Why is it always the poor that decide to stay?</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_MEET1">So, it was you who called us.</entry>
<entry name="GRIMM_MEET2">Well met, my friend. Well met. I am Grimm, master of this troupe.&lt;page&gt;The lantern has been lit, and your summons heeded. A fine stage you choose, this kingdom fallowed by worm and root, perfect earth upon which our Ritual shall take place.&lt;page&gt;And you, my friend. Your own part is far from over.</entry>
<entry name="MIDWIFE_WEAVERSONG">Ohhhh.. Heehee. Been prying about the weavers&#39; home, have you my dear? Quite brazen to pilfer that special charm.&lt;page&gt;Amazing things the weavers once crafted on their looms; stories, shields, spells. So much of our history was spun upon their spools. Your little friends there are testament to their talents... heehee.&lt;page&gt;Oh! I do apologise. I&#39;ve just felt a rumbling down below, in my belly. Just wait right there a moment. Don&#39;t you move now...</entry>
<entry name="BRUMM_LANTERN_DREAM">Master... are even you a slave? If so, let our chains be broken together!</entry>
<entry name="NYMM_MEET">Ah. Hello! Hello! I&#39;m new around these parts, so it&#39;s marvelous to see so friendly a face, in such a sad town.&lt;page&gt;The old bug over there was very welcoming, but still I find the place a little melancholy, what with the wind, and the darkness, and the sense of decline... I was hoping my music could go some way to livening up the place.&lt;page&gt;And now you&#39;ve arrived with that wonderful, charming aura about you. The whole town feels brighter for it.&lt;page&gt;Before you hurry about your business, I&#39;ve a small gift to commemorate a wonderful new friendship. No use for it myself, but I believe it&#39;d look rather fancy upon you.&lt;page&gt;Please, enjoy it, and lets hope to see much more of one another about town.</entry>
<entry name="LEG_EATER_GOLD1">Eaurgh... Eaaauuurrgggh?!&lt;page&gt;My charm! What did you do to it?! The smell... different. Strange, but nice. Very nice!&lt;page&gt;That smell... talks to me. Someone, somewhere... very nice.</entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_REFUSE">Eeuuarrggh! Why?!&lt;page&gt;Little lovely, don&#39;t do nasty things. Don&#39;t be cruel. Show it to me! That beautiful thing was made for me... I can smell it!</entry>
<entry name="GRIMMSYCOPHANT_DREAM">Master... my role.... apart from you... apart from kin. It pains me so.</entry>
<entry name="MOTHSTONE_DREAM">Protect yourself... You are our last...</entry>
<entry name="JIJI_GRIMM">Hmm. A fierce host has settled nearby. Did you summon them? I find their smell... unsettling.&lt;page&gt;Theirs is a scent of distant places, unfamiliar even to me.&lt;page&gt;They have a strange look to them, gaudy and intimidating. Perhaps you suspect they hide their true appearance? You&#39;d be right. They favour projection over truth, shrouding themselves in forms dreamed.&lt;page&gt;Best be careful. Assisting them might benefit you, but who knows what suffering it may cause?</entry>
<entry name="LEG_EATER_GOLD3">Eaurgh... Eaaauuurrgggh!! Eaauurggh!&lt;page&gt;Those charms... that smell! So so much! I want to... yesss!&lt;page&gt;I know where you are now. Above me. Much above me, but I know where to go. I will come! Don&#39;t try to hide from me!</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_NYMM">Ah ha! Good riddance! That creepy carnival has vanished and town&#39;s returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like it.&lt;page&gt;And we&#39;ve gained a new addition to the square! I found the fellow just outside of town. Seemed a little confused at first. Claims to be from far away, though he&#39;s hazy on the details.&lt;page&gt;Whatever his past, he&#39;s a rather good musician, and this town&#39;s spent far too long listening only to the wind. Thanks to him, we&#39;ve gained a new tune and some new company!</entry>
<entry name="IGOR_DREAM">When flame burns bright inside one&#39;s mind&lt;br&gt;Kin heed the call &#39;cross lands and time.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_GRIMM">Ahh! Look there! Something strange and sinister has suddenly appeared!&lt;page&gt;Ugh, it fills me with dread. I think it best I try to ignore it. </entry>
<entry name="DIVINE_ALL_EATEN">Ahhhhh. Such beautiful, special gifts. So lovely!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m ready now. Very ready!&lt;page&gt;My smell... you&#39;ll carry it with you, then?</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_TROUPE_LEFT">Ah ha! Good riddance! That creepy carnival has vanished and the town&#39;s returned to its former self, nice and quiet as I like it.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s quite enough to deal with just the occasional traveller. Whole structures appearing out of nowhere, dreadful music, horrific masks, all far more than one old bug should have to face.</entry>
