<entry name="DEEPNEST_BOUGHT">W-w-what a horrid warren of angry beasts. It&#39;s going to take a whole lot of effort to climb out of this dark pit. I think I-I&#39;ll hide here a little longer. </entry>
<entry name="OUTSKIRTS_BOUGHT">Judging by this wall, the city&#39;s folk seemed hesitant to build further into these caverns. I wonder what kept them at bay?</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_REFUSE">Not interested, then? Yes, quite understandable. Exploring without a map, finding your own way through unknown caverns... All very nourishing for the soul.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps we&#39;ll meet again on our travels.</entry>
<entry name="OUTSKIRTS_GREET">Isn&#39;t this a cosy hole? I&#39;ve been venturing about that wilderness beside here and thought a moment&#39;s break was well called for.&lt;page&gt;The landscape&#39;s all rather serene this side of the city, though the inhabitants are as ferocious as ever. </entry>
<entry name="ABYSS_GREET">Old caverns these ones. Can&#39;t you just feel the weight of the kingdom above? It&#39;s a heavy thing alright. &lt;page&gt;I reckon not many&#39;d reach these depths. We&#39;re pioneers you and I, at least in recent history.</entry>
<entry name="ROYAL_GARDENS_BOUGHT">There&#39;s a Stag Station at the heart of these gardens. I would&#39;ve taken my rest there if someone hadn&#39;t gone and locked the door. </entry>
<entry name="ROYAL_GARDENS_GREET">Have you heard of Hallownest&#39;s Queen? Apparently these gardens were once her retreat.&lt;page&gt;Now some vicious types are crawling all over the place and the plants have grown wild.&lt;page&gt;As inhospitable as it is, I&#39;ve enjoyed my travels here. Care to see my efforts?</entry>
<entry name="FOG_CANYON_GREET">Ho ho! As odd as much of Hallownest can be, there&#39;s a whole new level of strangeness about these caves.&lt;page&gt;Did you see that dark gate below? It&#39;s quite unsettling to be near. I did my best to avoid it.&lt;page&gt;Fortunate for me, I found another route in, though I did end up a little singed after wading through some acid.</entry>
<entry name="CLIFFS_GREET">Enjoying the bracing air? We&#39;re quite close to Hallownest&#39;s borders and those desolate plains that surround it. &lt;page&gt;In this direction, I&#39;m about as far as I&#39;m willing to go, though it&#39;s been a pleasant change from the tight confines of the caverns.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve drawn out a small map for the area. It&#39;s a simple one and more for completion really. Not knowing the full extents of a region can be quite frustrating.</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_AGAIN_DP">Y-you want to buy a map after all?</entry>
<entry name="CLIFFS_BOUGHT">I chanced upon a strange bug atop these cliffs. His house isn&#39;t far from here. &lt;page&gt;A very imposing figure he was and no doubt lethal with a Nail. I suspect you two might share more in common than him and I.</entry>
<entry name="CROSSROADS_BOUGHT">How are you finding my map? I&#39;ve tried to fill out as much as I can, but every map is a work in progress.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;d like to fill out some of the map yourself you can purchase some mapping supplies from my wife up in Dirtmouth. We&#39;ve set up a little store to help make ends meet.</entry>
<entry name="CITY_GREET">Isn&#39;t this a change from those twisting natural caverns? The rain does cast something of a sadness upon it all but the architecture is simply splendid.&lt;page&gt;Charting such a different space is quite the challenge, though one I&#39;ve eagerly undertaken.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps you&#39;d care to purchase a copy of my achievements so far? </entry>
<entry name="WATERWAYS_BOUGHT">I&#39;d wager these pipes and chambers were once used to carry the city&#39;s waste. Would&#39;ve been a horrid stench down here. Thankfully that constant rain has flushed them clean. </entry>
<entry name="FUNGAL_WASTES_BOUGHT">There&#39;s a potent odour about these caverns and far worse for me I suspect. My trunk is quite sensitive whereas you don&#39;t seem to possess a scent organ of any kind.&lt;page&gt;Is it that you cannot smell at all?</entry>
<entry name="FUNGAL_WASTES_GREET">Ahh my short friend, you&#39;ve caught me at the perfect time. I&#39;m just about finished charting these noxious caverns.&lt;page&gt;Very territorial types make their homes within this area. I&#39;d suggest avoiding them where possible.&lt;page&gt;Further below some strange thin creatures gave me quite a scare. They seemed an intelligent bunch.&lt;page&gt;In my youth I&#39;d have braved their caves but I fear my matured physique wouldn&#39;t be able to outrun them were they to turn violent.</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_MEET">Hmm? Ah, hello there. Come down to explore these beautiful old ruins? Don&#39;t mind me.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve a fondness for exploring myself. Getting lost and finding your way again is a pleasure like no other. We&#39;re exquisitely lucky, you and I.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m a cartographer by trade, and I&#39;m working on mapping this area right now. Would you like to buy a copy of my work so far?</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_MEET_DP">Hh-hello. I&#39;m Cornifer. I&#39;m a m-mapper by trade. I&#39;ve tried to chart the dense nest beneath here b-b-but it&#39;s proving too dangerous for a bug like me.&lt;page&gt;Vicious little creatures burst out all o-over the place and the passages are a dark, twisting maze. Even with my good head for direction, I-I-I&#39;ve had enough&lt;page&gt;Unless you&#39;re well prepared, I&#39;d urge you to leave, though if you&#39;re feeling strong enough to descend, would you like to buy m-my meagre map?</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_ISELDA">A map can be a useful thing, but it alone won&#39;t show you where you are. If you&#39;ve not the head for directions, I suggest purchasing a compass from my wife, Iselda.&lt;page&gt;She&#39;s just now opening our new map shop in Dirtmouth, selling all sorts of useful things to wanderers like yourself. She&#39;ll even sell some of my old maps from time to time.&lt;page&gt;I pop back to see her whenever I finish mapping an area. She&#39;s always so excited to see me.</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_INTRO_1">Oh, by the way, I haven&#39;t introduced myself have I? Yes, I should apologise for that. When you spend a lot of time by yourself, with just your own thoughts, you forget the niceties of conversation.</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_INTRO_2">My name is Cornifer, and I&#39;ve always loved exploring the world. Why, when I was first hatched I wandered off immediately, leaving my brothers and sisters and poor mother behind! &lt;page&gt;That&#39;s why as soon as I could I moved to Dirtmouth with my wife. A huge, unending Kingdom to explore right on our doorstep. Who could resist?&lt;page&gt;Anyway, I&#39;ll let you return to your travels. With a little luck, we&#39;ll meet again. Be safe and farewell!</entry>
<entry name="DREAM">...To chart the world. What joy... If only Iselda could share the thrill...</entry>
<entry name="DEEPNEST_GREET">This p-place gives me the creeps. Vicious little creatures burst out all o-over the place and the passages are a dark, twisting maze.&lt;page&gt;Unless you&#39;re well prepared, I&#39;d urge you to leave, though if you&#39;re feeling strong enough to descend, would you like to buy my map?</entry>
<entry name="ABYSS_BOUGHT">It&#39;s a long trek back to the shop from here. I&#39;ll be resting my legs a little longer.&lt;page&gt;Not too long though! It won&#39;t do to have Iselda worrying after me.</entry>
<entry name="CROSSROADS_GREET">Hello again! Still winding your way through these beautiful highways? Just imagine how they must have looked during the kingdom&#39;s height, thick with traffic and bustling with life! I wish I could have seen it.&lt;page&gt;Oh, and I suppose I should ask... are you interested in buying a copy of my map for this area...?</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_REFUSE_DP">N-not interested in the map?</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_AGAIN">Hmm? Have you changed your mind about buying a map?</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_NOT_ENOUGH_DP">N-not enough Geo?</entry>
<entry name="MINES_GREET">Come to scale the mountain? I&#39;ve heard tale of a summit way up there. Too far for me though and I&#39;m not really one for heights. </entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_PROMPT">Purchase a map of the area?</entry>
<entry name="GREENPATH_BOUGHT">I ran into another traveller as I made my way down here. I tried to call out to her as she dashed past but she barely even glanced in my direction. Not an appreciater of maps like you and I, obviously.</entry>
<entry name="WATERWAYS_GREET">Ho ho! Aren&#39;t these waterways thrilling? A labyrinth of pipes and tunnels.&lt;page&gt;I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better place to employ my talents. It&#39;s all so orderly, so considered, nothing like the crude irregularity of those caverns.&lt;page&gt;Ahh but so sad, my trunk is telling me those Fungal Wastes are close and I sense my damp adventure may have reached its end. Guess I&#39;ll be calling this map done.</entry>
<entry name="CORNIFER_NOT_ENOUGH">You don&#39;t have enough Geo? Ah, I understand. I&#39;d give you the map as a gift, but I don&#39;t think my wife would be very happy if I did. &quot;All our food is made of Geo&quot;, as they say.</entry>
<entry name="CARD">Sorry I missed you! If you&#39;re feeling lost, why not pop up to our store in Dirtmouth and purchase a map of this area? Available now for an excellent price!&lt;br&gt;                                                             - Cornifer</entry>
<entry name="CITY_BOUGHT">We&#39;ve both come far to reach this grand place. While I&#39;m about these buildings, I must remember to collect a trinket or two for Iselda.  </entry>
<entry name="MINES_BOUGHT">I jabbed myself on one of those crystals back there. Awful sharp they are and all over the place. You&#39;d best watch yourself if you&#39;re heading up. </entry>
<entry name="GREENPATH_GREET">Isn&#39;t this a contrast from the Crossroads? Such a humid, lively place. The roads twist and turn in the most wonderful ways.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve done my best to chart the area ahead, though I must admit some of the area&#39;s inhabitants proved quite a nuisance.</entry>
<entry name="FOG_CANYON_BOUGHT">There&#39;s a large building just below here, out in the middle of a lake and a marvel to observe.&lt;page&gt;I tried to head in, but it&#39;s become a nest for those slimey, see-through creatures.&lt;page&gt;Ugh. They&#39;re just so... gross, and they give a nasty shock to touch. </entry>
