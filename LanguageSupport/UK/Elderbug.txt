<entry name="ELDERBUG_MAP_SHOP_OPEN">A young couple&#39;s just recently taken up residence in the house beside the station. Seems they&#39;re running a map shop, which may excite adventurous types like yourself.&lt;page&gt;She&#39;s a tall bug, the wife. I told them to take a larger house, especially given they&#39;re all empty, but they liked the look of that one.&lt;page&gt;The way she has to bend just to get through the door...I wouldn&#39;t put up with it myself.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_FLOWER_REREQUEST">You&#39;re still holding onto that exquisite bloom... have you changed your mind? Are you really giving me something so precious?</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_INTRO_MAIN">The other residents, they&#39;ve all disappeared. Headed down that well, one by one, into the caverns below.&lt;page&gt;Used to be there was a great kingdom beneath our town. It&#39;s long fell to ruin, yet it still draws folks into its depths.&lt;page&gt;Wealth, glory, enlightenment, that darkness seems to promise all things. I&#39;m sure you too seek your dreams down there.&lt;page&gt;Well watch out. It&#39;s a sickly air that fills the place. Creatures turn mad and travellers are robbed of their memories.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps dreams aren&#39;t such great things after all...</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_CROSSROADS_INFECTED">Ehhh...A sharp sickly smell has started to drift from the well beside town. I&#39;d thought those depths ominous before, now they seem just dreadful.&lt;page&gt;Whatever horrid curse afflicts this ruin, I&#39;d wager it&#39;s grown stronger than ever. </entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_ANCIENT_BASIN">Did you know the caverns continue even below the capital? Few have ventured that deep so the details are scant.&lt;page&gt;Those who made it back told of impossibly old structures and roads formed as though the rock itself possessed a will.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_INTRO_NORMAL">Ho there, traveller. I&#39;m afraid there&#39;s only me left to offer welcome. Our town&#39;s fallen quiet you see.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_TEMPLE_VISITED">Did you visit that temple? A strange building I&#39;ve heard, though I&#39;d never dare the journey myself.&lt;page&gt;The braver among us once went there to pray, said they felt at peace within the walls. After a while, they stopped going. I wonder what changed?</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_GENERIC_1">There&#39;s something strange about you. I&#39;ve seen all types pass below, but you... You&#39;re almost familiar, though I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve never met before.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_GENERIC_2">Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you it&#39;s quite comfortable. There&#39;s no better place to collect your thoughts before heading below. &lt;page&gt;Plus I enjoy the company. Not that you seem the talkative sort.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_GOSSIP_HINT">It&#39;s a sprawling land beneath us. If you&#39;re ever feeling lost or would care for some direction, come speak with me. I may be able to suggest a new sight or a new path you&#39;d never before considered.&lt;page&gt;Suprised? Despite my lack of experience, I&#39;m actually quite knowledgeable about the lay of the kingdom below. I&#39;ve listened to countless stories from travellers and explorers just like yourself.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have your own grand tale to tell once you&#39;re finished down there. Either that or you&#39;ll be dead! I&#39;ll admit, in Hallownest, the latter is far more common.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_FLOWER_REQUEST">Hm? What&#39;s that you have there? Ah! What a beautiful flower!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d never have guessed by looking, but you have surprisingly good taste in flora. Why are you carrying around such an exquisite bloom?&lt;page&gt;Wait... you didn&#39;t...? Ahh!&lt;page&gt;This flower is... is it a gift? For me? Are you really giving me something so precious?</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_STAG_STATION_REOPENED">I never thought I&#39;d see such a thing. The Stag Station has opened! That building lay silent since before even my time.&lt;page&gt;Oh, I&#39;ve heard the tales of the glorious lines. A web of tunnels running all through the kingdom. Not that I&#39;ll be travelling them, mind you!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m quite content where I am.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_BRETTA_RETURNED">That lovely young lass returned to us!&lt;page&gt;I must admit, I&#39;d placed thin odds on her survival.&lt;page&gt;Seems to think very highly of her rescuer, some sort of dashing, warrior type. Barely stopped gushing since she got back.&lt;page&gt;The warrior must have passed down below whilst I was taking my nap. Such a shame. I&#39;d have loved to meet so impressive a bug.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_FLOWER_ACCEPT">Ah! I can really have it? My, my... I barely know what to say except... thank you!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d resigned myself to selflessly giving out advice to passers by, without receiving any gratitude in return. Little did I know, one young bug was taking my words to heart and would repay my kindness.&lt;page&gt;And with such a beautiful gift! Ahh. Suddenly, the world seems a little less faded.&lt;page&gt;Thank you, my friend. I will take care of this flower while you&#39;re gone, so we can enjoy it together when you return.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_FUNGAL_WASTES">My understanding of Hallownest can be a little vague, but below those leafy caverns is a fungal grove, once home to peaceful creatures not quite bug and not quite plant.&lt;page&gt;Sounds almost worth a visit no? Well there&#39;s a downside, the dreadful stench! A noxious odour fills the place. </entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_FLOWER_DECLINE">Oh. My mistake. Yes. Very foolish of me. I don&#39;t know why I thought you&#39;d go to so much effort for a simple old bug.&lt;page&gt;Appreciating others and being considerate... these aren&#39;t skills that everyone is born with.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_SHOPKEEP_RETURNED">Oh, what a turn! Our shopkeep&#39;s come home. Just wandered back in. I&#39;d hoped for grand tales of his time below, but he seems to remember almost nothing! Maybe it was all too much for him?&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;re interested in his wares, watch out! He drives a hard bargain, that one.&lt;page&gt;No competition. That&#39;s the problem. It&#39;s bad for the market. Not that he&#39;s complaining.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_DREAM_FLOWER">These petals... so white. Can you see them too... watching me from wherever you are?&lt;page&gt;Perhaps dreams aren&#39;t such bad things after all...</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_GREENPATH">I used to think the kingdom below was all dead cold rock, but I&#39;ve since been told different. Travellers speak of startling variety in Hallownest&#39;s caverns. Even just besides those Crossroads there&#39;s meant to be an area filled with leafy greenery.&lt;page&gt;I told those same travellers about the wonderful grasses that grow around the town. They didn&#39;t seem impressed. </entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_HISTORY_1">Many used to come, hoping the kingdom would fulfill their desires. &lt;page&gt;Hallownest, it was once called. Supposedly the greatest kingdom there ever was, full of treasures and secrets.&lt;page&gt;Hm. Now it&#39;s nothing more than a poisonous tomb full of monsters and madness.&lt;page&gt;Everything fades eventually, I suppose.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_HISTORY_2">I hope you aren&#39;t too disappointed by our little town, traveller. Though it&#39;s now a solemn place, once we were much more welcoming.&lt;page&gt;Entry to the kingdom was forbidden long ago, supposedly after some great calamity. Many gates were closed, but our old well remains as a way to creep back in.&lt;page&gt;Over the years, all kinds used the well to wriggle into the ruins, wanderers, thieves, adventurers.&lt;page&gt;Funny how few ever come back up. Perhaps they find what they&#39;re looking for?..&lt;page&gt;Bah, I&#39;m not so naive. No doubt, they&#39;ve all been gobbled up! There are countless dangers in those depths.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_INTRO_VISITEDCROSSROAD">Oh! You&#39;re back! You walked straight past me and descended down into the ruins without even saying hello! I thought maybe I&#39;d seen a ghost.&lt;page&gt;The mind sometimes plays tricks on you when you spend a lot of time alone.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_RESTING_GROUNDS">Apparently, the many graves of Hallownest are enough to fill an entire network of caverns. Somewhere above the city it&#39;s told. Sounds a gloomy sight.&lt;page&gt;Bah, I&#39;m content with our own humble plot. In our boom times, we even had a gravedigger! Not a bad sort he was, though dead now.&lt;page&gt;He, didn&#39;t die to the dangers of Hallownest mind you. That one fell into an open grave and couldn&#39;t climb out.&lt;page&gt;I found the corpse myself. Dreadful nuisance. I&#39;ve since had to tend the graves myself.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_FLOWER_GENERIC">This flower you gave me... when dark thoughts creep into my head I gaze at it and think of you.&lt;page&gt;Why not rest at the bench here for a while? We can enjoy the flower together before you head off again.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_INTRO_WALKEDBY">Oh! You came back! You walked straight past me, I thought maybe I&#39;d faded away along with this town.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_STAG_STATION_GREET">There’s something about you little traveller. The winds are changing.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_MINES_LIFT">That noisy old lift, where does it go? Up to the old mines they carved into the peak, I suppose.&lt;page&gt;Have you been up there? Is it true that crystals grow everywhere you step?&lt;page&gt;A villager brought some of those crystals back to the village once. I don&#39;t quite understand the allure myself.&lt;page&gt;You can&#39;t eat them, and they don&#39;t make very good pillows. They hardly seem worth all the trouble to me.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_TOWN_GREET_4">If you do meet my fellows down there you might remind them of their poor Elder, up here, back aching, abandoned to his lonesome vigil. Poor poor me!...&lt;page&gt;Oh I&#39;m fine, really, but a bit of guilt might go some way in persuading their return. Assuming they&#39;re still alive that is.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_BLACK_EGG_OPENED">I heard a piercing cry from the well. It echoed about my mind and left me all a daze.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d say it was a foul beast&#39;s death, but this cry sounded different...divine? Has something happened little traveller?&lt;page&gt;No. Don&#39;t tell me. If foul events are brewing, it&#39;s probably better I don&#39;t know.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_DREAM">To descend into that ruin...Why? Things are so much simpler up here.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_DUNG">Can you... smell something? There&#39;s suddenly a horrid stench in the air.&lt;page&gt;I swear, the town usually smells much nicer than this. Please accept my humble apology!</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_JIJI_DOOR">Faring well in your adventures below? Well I had an adventure of my own while you were gone.&lt;page&gt;I don&#39;t usually visit the town&#39;s graveyard, but I thought I&#39;d go and visit the grave of an old friend.&lt;page&gt;As I was walking amongst the tombstones, I noticed a strange kind of chanting coming from somewhere nearby. Extremely sinister chanting!&lt;page&gt;I looked around to find the source, and I saw two bright, horrible, huge eyes staring at me from the door of a dark cave!&lt;page&gt;I pretended I hadn&#39;t heard the voice or seen the eyes and scurried back to town. My friend will have to wait a little longer for her visit...</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_CRYSTAL_PEAK">Did you see that tall cliff beyond the town&#39;s graveyard? That&#39;s only the base of a much larger peak.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s mines and machinery and all sorts of valuable rock forms inside. Many a traveller through Dirtmouth headed straight for it.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_TOWN_GREET_3">Feeling tired? That bench may be iron, but I assure you it’s quite comfortable. There&#39;s no better place to collect your thoughts before heading below.&lt;page&gt;Plus, I&#39;d enjoy the company, even if you&#39;re not the most talkative sort.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_KINGS_PASS">To reach Dirtmouth, most travellers take circuitous routes around the cliffs beside us. It&#39;s a hard trek now but in the kingdom&#39;s prime things were far simpler.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s an old pass in the cliffs that once allowed easy access. The bridge up to it has long since crumbled away, and even without it, a huge door bars entry.&lt;page&gt;I can&#39;t complain mind you. It&#39;s meant we&#39;ve only ever had to accommodate a trickle of travellers, even during our busiest times.&lt;page&gt;I wouldn&#39;t want hordes of bugs to descend on Dirtmouth. I like the quiet.</entry>
<entry name="ELDERBUG_HINT_CITY_OF_TEARS">Hallownest&#39;s great capital is what most of you brave types come to see. Thinking to loot its treasures I suppose? It must be brimming with them.&lt;page&gt;The city&#39;s right at the centre of the kingdom, though I&#39;ve heard the gates are sealed, so gaining entry can be difficult.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;d be a rich bug that could return with even a fraction of the wealth inside. Despite my age, I&#39;ve only seen few who&#39;ve managed it. Must say something of the dangers about its streets.</entry>
