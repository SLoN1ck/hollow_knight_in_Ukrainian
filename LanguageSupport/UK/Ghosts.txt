<entry name="ATRA_REPEAT">My appearance should not cause you worry. Here I am truly at peace.</entry>
<entry name="REVEK_TALK_DEFEAT_REPEAT">To protect? Was that my task? If so, who was I protecting? It&#39;s only you and me here. </entry>
<entry name="CHAGAX_REPEAT">Any victory against death will always be temporary.... What a gloomy thought.</entry>
<entry name="THISTLEWIND_REPEAT">You find it strange to see a moth wielding a weapon? We are a passive species, though I am not the only one amongst us to take up arms.&lt;page&gt;Another braved the edges of this world, hoping to uncover a truth long forgotten.&lt;page&gt;I wonder what became of him?</entry>
<entry name="NOEYES_INSPECT">A face carved from stone.</entry>
<entry name="XERO_INSPECT">Cursed are those who turn against the King.</entry>
<entry name="POGGY_TALK">Skroink! You look pretty skinny. Very scrawny. That&#39;s the way to be I reckon.&lt;page&gt;Just look at me! A great big, juicy, fatty, oily... scrumptious bug. No wonder I&#39;m so popular around here.</entry>
<entry name="MARKOTH_INSPECT">The body of a warrior, with a shield and nails.</entry>
<entry name="MUMCAT_REPEAT">Shall we wait together, stranger? Shall we play together?</entry>
<entry name="ALADAR_INSPECT">Here lies Gorb, the Great Mind.</entry>
<entry name="MUMCAT_DEFEAT">Oh, stranger... you&#39;re strong. Much stronger than me...&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve been waiting a long time, stranger. I&#39;ve been fighting a long time, stranger.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m very, very tired! The Queen will be here soon, and I just need to sleep a little.&lt;page&gt;Wake me when the Queen arrives, stranger. Perhaps the Queen will teach us both to fly, stranger!&lt;page&gt;That... would be fun... wouldn&#39;t it...?</entry>
<entry name="CASPIAN_TALK">Beware your own mind little one. Twisted minds breed dark deeds and mine was more twisted than most.&lt;page&gt;I thought it would be my end, but instead I found this glade and with it a sort of peace.</entry>
<entry name="GARRO_TALK">Are you a warrior, little one? A true warrior is one who can stand strong in the midst of a storm.</entry>
<entry name="WAYNER_REPEAT">I&#39;m envious of you, facing this world without fear. I could stand to learn from your approach.</entry>
<entry name="KARINA_TALK">Are you admiring my fabulous markings? I&#39;m of a distinguished species you see, though I&#39;ve not seen another like me for the longest time.</entry>
<entry name="MILLY_TALK">Buy my cookies! They&#39;re ever so tasty.</entry>
<entry name="REVEK_REPEAT">I assure you wanderer, my nail is sharp and I&#39;ll not hold back.</entry>
<entry name="PERPETOS_TALK">Are you enjoying your time in our glade? I&#39;d offer advice, though to have made it here you&#39;re obviously quite adept at navigating our world and its perils.</entry>
<entry name="GARRO_REPEAT">Stand strong little warrior.</entry>
<entry name="REVEK_TALK_DEFEAT">The glade has stilled. It&#39;s so quiet, yet I feel... failure? In this place, I once performed a task, but what was it?..  It&#39;s so hard to recall. Surely it was important? How could I forget such a thing?</entry>
<entry name="MOLTEN_REPEAT">Though my body sheds and changes my core remains the same.</entry>
<entry name="GRAVEDIGGER_TALK">Ehh... Another wielding a weapon. I suppose you&#39;ll be leaving many a corpse in your wake?&lt;page&gt; If you won&#39;t spare thought for the dead at least consider all the extra work you force upon those in my profession.  </entry>
<entry name="HU_DEFEAT">My mind... it clears. Have we been... sleeping, child?&lt;page&gt;Aah... I remember. Those proud lords... were they truly monsters? I remember their eyes now... bright and clear. Why then did I fear them so?&lt;page&gt;If there was madness in that village, it was I who brought it. They were right to cast me out.&lt;page&gt;When I attacked, they were right to...&lt;page&gt;They were right to kill...&lt;page&gt;To kill... me...?&lt;page&gt;...aah.</entry>
<entry name="MILLY_REPEAT">Buy my cookies! Once I&#39;ve sold them all I can go home.</entry>
<entry name="HIVEQUEEN_EXTRA">My Knight... At last you are freed.</entry>
<entry name="MAGNUS_REPEAT">Remember tiny bug, crush your fears; crush your problems; crush your foes.</entry>
<entry name="NOEYES_DEFEAT">One by one... their eyes closed at last. I felt it... a warm stillness falling over us.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m sorry I was frightened of you. You were always protecting us, even when we couldn&#39;t see you.&lt;page&gt;Take us there, please. A place where light can not haunt us, a place without dreams...Please...</entry>
<entry name="GRASSHOPPER_TALK">Isn&#39;t this just the most intriguing place? So many discoveries waiting to be made. We&#39;re about to set off ourselves, though we can&#39;t seem to agree on which way to head.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s led to something of an argument between us. We should really stop squabbling about such petty things. </entry>
<entry name="GRAVEDIGGER_REPEAT">Do as you will little wanderer. Cut a path toward your goal.&lt;page&gt;I shouldn&#39;t complain. It&#39;s your kind that keeps folks like me in business.</entry>
<entry name="FALSE_KNIGHT">I wanted it.... the strength to protect the others...&lt;page&gt;When I saw that Knight... sleeping... safe in his big armoured shell...&lt;page&gt;It wasn&#39;t madness that drove me to it... I just wanted it...&lt;page&gt;But... in the end? If strength cannot save you, then what can...?</entry>
<entry name="KCIN_TALK">I was once obsessed with power though my time within this glade has shed me of such desire.&lt;page&gt;What folly it was to ever crave such a vicious thing. </entry>
<entry name="CASPIAN_REPEAT">Do you think dark thoughts little one? When hidden behind a visage as impassive as your own, I find it hard to tell.</entry>
<entry name="MARISSA_REPEAT">Even if only you, it&#39;s a wonderful thing to have an audience again.</entry>
<entry name="NOEYES_REPEAT">Precious children, a monster has come for us in the dark...Will you sing for me?</entry>
<entry name="THISTLEWIND_TALK">Ahhh, a wanderer.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve been many places and done a great many things, but I suspect you will outdo me by far.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve long ceased travelling the caverns of Hallownest and I suspect they&#39;re now far more dangerous than in my journeys, though with your capable air I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll do fine.&lt;page&gt;Good luck! It&#39;s a vast world out there.</entry>
<entry name="100NAIL_TALK">Do you like my nails little wanderer? I carry only three, far less than legends may suggest.&lt;page&gt;Still! Each is sharper than the last and I&#39;d require only one to cut you down. </entry>
<entry name="GRASSHOPPER_REPEAT">Left or right? Which way is best? It should be a simple thing, yet we&#39;re always at odds.  </entry>
<entry name="GROHAC_REPEAT">These husks around my neck? They&#39;re my precious friends, always there to keep me company and much better for conversation than the rest of the odd lot around here.</entry>
<entry name="JONI_TALK">Ahhh, I see you bear my blessing. I can&#39;t remember giving it, but my memory has been a little lacking of late.</entry>
<entry name="MARKOTH_DEFEAT">Never... have I been defeated in combat.&lt;page&gt;I can... see myself there, still sleeping. How long have I been hidden here?&lt;page&gt;Here at the edge of the world, no-one could find me... except you.&lt;page&gt;Warriors, knights, kings, even time itself... they have no power over me. Only you.&lt;page&gt;You are the darkness... come to consume me.</entry>
<entry name="WALDIE_REPEAT">You wouldn&#39;t have the guts to face me anyway.</entry>
<entry name="HIVEQUEEN_TALK">Small thing. I know your kind.&lt;page&gt;If you attempt to resolve your past then know I am not the queen you seek.&lt;page&gt;It is the pale beings that bear blame for your nature.&lt;page&gt;Though this hive exists within Hallownest, we play no part in its attempt at perpetuation.</entry>
<entry name="MOLTEN_TALK">Don&#39;t fear my rotting form. Though my body sheds and changes my core remains the same.</entry>
<entry name="BOSS_REPEAT">You too are a warrior? I see your nail, but your shell seems underdeveloped. In your current state, to travel a land as dangerous as this seems unwise.</entry>
<entry name="GROHAC_TALK">We&#39;re always left with reminders of the errors we&#39;ve made. Let your mistakes not burden you, but serve as guideposts on where not to travel.</entry>
<entry name="100NAIL_REPEAT">Aren&#39;t my nails the most wonderful things? Their gleaming blades so sharp and deadly. </entry>
<entry name="GALIEN_REPEAT">So then... shall we do battle? Let us test our strength in joyful combat!</entry>
<entry name="MUMCAT_TALK">Oh! The Queen! The Queen is coming! I&#39;ve been waiting so long, and now she&#39;s almost here! I feel like I&#39;m about to burst!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve kept it safe, this sacred garden! I&#39;ve kept it safe for all this time, and soon the Queen will return and teach me to fly!&lt;page&gt;Shall we wait together, stranger? Shall we play together?</entry>
<entry name="ALADAR_TALK">I am Gorb!&lt;page&gt;Bow! Bow bow bow bow to Gorb!&lt;page&gt;The great mind! I am Gorb!&lt;page&gt;Ascend! Ascend! Ascend ascend ascend with Gorb!</entry>
<entry name="MARKOTH_REPEAT">Raise your weapon then, fool, and die like those who came before you.</entry>
<entry name="POGGY_REPEAT">I&#39;ve been waiting an awfully long while. Surely it&#39;s dinner time soon?</entry>
<entry name="MARISSA_TALK">Welcome to my stage little one. I am Marissa, a songstress of some renown, though given the sorry state of this place, you may find it hard to believe. &lt;page&gt;Huge crowds once flocked to hear me sing, then something changed. The audience, once so enrapt, began to leave. I continued to sing yet my voice fell silent upon their ears.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps you&#39;d care to listen to me sing? You&#39;ll be the first in an age to hear it.</entry>
<entry name="MARKOTH_TALK">You have come a long way, just to die here at the edge of the world.&lt;page&gt;No, do not speak. I have heard thousands and thousands of empty words from those like you. Your pride, your desires, your desperation... you will take these things with you once I strike you down.&lt;page&gt;Raise your weapon then, and die like those who came before you.</entry>
<entry name="CHAGAX_TALK">I used to help others. They were brought to me sick and dying... What difference did it make?...&lt;page&gt;Any victory against death will always be temporary.</entry>
<entry name="MAGNUS_TALK">All of life&#39;s problems can be solved with crushing force. Such a simple mantra and one I&#39;ve always lived by.&lt;page&gt;If you weren&#39;t so scrawny, I&#39;d suggest you follow my example.</entry>
<entry name="HIVEQUEEN_REPEAT">To rail against nature is folly. All things must accept an end. </entry>
<entry name="KARINA_REPEAT">You don&#39;t seem to bear the markings of rank, though you bear no markings of a lower form.&lt;page&gt;What are you? Do tell me. Are you a higher being or just another lowly grub? </entry>
<entry name="KCIN_REPEAT">Seeking power is a hollow goal. Best to search for other things.</entry>
<entry name="ATRA_TALK">Don&#39;t fear little creature. Though a violent rage once possessed me the peaceful air in this place seems to keep it at bay. </entry>
<entry name="PERPETOS_REPEAT">You&#39;re very impressive for such a small thing. I&#39;m something of a warrior myself, though even I&#39;d hesitate to raise my nail against you.</entry>
<entry name="GALIEN_TALK">Hoh, a fellow warrior, out here? I thought I was the only one brave enough and strong enough to survive in this foul, forgotten pit.&lt;page&gt;I am Galien, the strongest warrior in Hallownest! I came to this monstrous place to test my strength. No doubt you wish to test your might as well, hmm?&lt;page&gt;Yes, you and I are a rare breed, quite unlike this poor fellow who has fallen before us. The world is not kind to the weak, I fear.&lt;page&gt;So then... shall we do battle? Let us test our strength in joyful combat!</entry>
<entry name="HU_REPEAT">Beware dreams of glory, child. Turn back, and do not return.</entry>
<entry name="NOEYES_TALK">My child... can you still see? Please, don&#39;t hurt me.&lt;page&gt;Can&#39;t sleep... with your eyes open, little one. Can&#39;t dream... if you&#39;re still breathing, little one.&lt;page&gt;Precious children... you speak such loathsome things as you sleep... your claws scratch and scrape...&lt;page&gt;Precious children, a monster has come for us in the dark...Will you sing for me?</entry>
<entry name="MAGE_LORD">In my dreams I could see it. The Kingdom&#39;s salvation, the cure for the plague... the answer was in the soul that animates our bodies.&lt;page&gt;But the King... why?! He opposed everything I did...&lt;page&gt;His jealousy... his madness... by standing against me he robbed me of my immortality!&lt;page&gt;Now the King and his Kingdom are dead... but I... will live forever.</entry>
<entry name="HU_INSPECT">We remember the Elder.</entry>
<entry name="REVEK_TALK">The bugs within this glade are under my watch. Treat them with respect and you may remain, but raise your nail and you&#39;ll contend with me.</entry>
<entry name="ALADAR_REPEAT">Ascend! Ascend! Ascend ascend ascend with Gorb!</entry>
<entry name="ALADAR_DEFEAT">I... am Gorb!&lt;page&gt;The great mind... the pain! Ascend! Ascend!&lt;page&gt;I... I am...</entry>
<entry name="XERO_TALK">Stop there! Those who try to leave this kingdom are cursed. Better to rest here, until time itself sleeps.&lt;page&gt;Hope and freedom. I thought that strength alone could grant me these things. In my dreams I would cut that plague with my nails, and then I turned my weapons upon the King.&lt;page&gt;When I awoke in this sacred place, I began to understand. Those who hope are already doomed.&lt;page&gt;Do you still hope, wanderer? Will you flee? Or will you raise your weapon and doom us both?</entry>
<entry name="WALDIE_TALK">Don&#39;t judge me by appearance. Though my stature is small, I bear a dark soul and a tendency to go berserk in battle.</entry>
<entry name="GALIEN_INSPECT">The body of a fallen warrior.</entry>
<entry name="MUMCAT_INSPECT">Protector of root and leaf, we honour you.</entry>
<entry name="GALIEN_DEFEAT">Unbelievable... I am defeated at last! So this is what it feels like to be bested...&lt;page&gt;Still though, I am strong, am I not? When you see our King, surely you&#39;ll tell him of my valour...?&lt;page&gt;Yes... he sent you here to test me, didn&#39;t he? I knew he had not forgotten brave Galien.&lt;page&gt;I am ready... to join you now. Brothers, you and I. Let us leave this place...&lt;page&gt;...together...</entry>
<entry name="HU_TALK">Wait, child! Why have you come here? Have you come to tame this savage, ruined land?&lt;page&gt;Many have come to purify this place, but all who dwell here are eventually consumed.&lt;page&gt;Yes, even the wild bugs lurking below us. They were once proud like you, but now they are only monsters.&lt;page&gt;Beware dreams of glory, child. Turn back, and do not return.</entry>
<entry name="WYATT_TALK">Watch out!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve an acidic touch and I wouldn&#39;t want you getting burned. It&#39;s a protection system of my kind, though something of a nuisance when it comes to meeting others.</entry>
<entry name="HEX_TALK">&quot;I&#39;ll see you soon,&quot; she said, though that was long ago. I wonder where she went?</entry>
<entry name="XERO_REPEAT">Do you still hope, wanderer? Will you flee? Or will you raise your weapon and doom us both?</entry>
<entry name="JONI_REPEAT">Isn&#39;t it just so peaceful here? Such a perfect place to rest.</entry>
<entry name="BOSS_TALK">I came from far away to reach this place. Though my shell may seem foreign, beneath it I am a bug the same as you.</entry>
<entry name="HEX_REPEAT">Go bother someone else. You&#39;re not the one I&#39;m waiting for.</entry>
<entry name="XERO_DEFEAT">Ah... I can see now. Those who turn against the King are doomed as soon as they raise their weapon.&lt;page&gt;Do not call me a traitor. Simply call me a fool.&lt;page&gt;I know you will not flee. Wherever you go... I will be watching.</entry>
<entry name="WAYNER_TALK">Hark, fellow adventurer! Are you heading out into the world? I&#39;d join you, but it&#39;s been so long, I fear I&#39;d lose my head.</entry>
<entry name="WYATT_REPEAT">Don&#39;t get too close. I&#39;d not wish to cause any harm.</entry>
