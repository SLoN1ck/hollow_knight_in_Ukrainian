<entry name="HORNET_SPIDER_TOWN_01">So you&#39;ve slain the Beast... and you head towards that fated goal.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d not have obstructed this happening, but it caused me some pain to knowingly stand idle.&lt;page&gt;...What? You might think me stern but I&#39;m not completely cold.&lt;page&gt;We do not choose our mothers, or the circumstance into which we are born. Despite all the ills of this world, I&#39;m thankful for the life she granted me.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s quite a debt I owed. Only in allowing her to pass, and taking the burden of the future in her stead, can I begin to repay it.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_DOOR_UNOPENED">I&#39;m impressed little ghost. You&#39;ve burdened yourself with the fate of this world, yet you still stand strong.&lt;page&gt;To break the Dreamer&#39;s seals would alone be considered an impossible task, but to accept that void inside yourself, that casts you as something rather exceptional.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_SPIDER_TOWN_DREAM">...Mother... Forgive my inaction... but another path may be possible...</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_OUTSKIRTS_1">So you&#39;d pursue the deeper truth? It isn&#39;t one the weak could bear.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_OUTSKIRTS_2">Prove yourself ready to face it. I&#39;ll not hold back. My needle is lethal and I&#39;d feel no sadness in a weakling&#39;s demise.&lt;page&gt;Show me you can accept this Kingdom&#39;s past and claim responsibility for its future. </entry>
<entry name="HORNET_PRE_FINAL_BATTLE">The path is opened. One way or another an end awaits inside.&lt;page&gt;I won&#39;t be joining you in this. That space is built to sustain your likes. Its bindings would drain me were I to join.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t be surprised. I&#39;ll not risk my own life in your attempt, though if the moment presents I&#39;ll aid as I&#39;m able.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_FINAL_BOSS">Do it! Make your choice. My thread will only hold so long.&lt;page&gt;Prolong our world&#39;s stasis or face the heart of its infection.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_ABYSS_ASCENT_01">Ghost. I see you&#39;ve faced the place of your birth, and now drape yourself in the substance of its shadow.&lt;page&gt;Though our strength is born of similar source, that part of you, that crucial emptiness, I do not share.&lt;page&gt;Funny then, that such darkness gives me hope. Within it, I see the chance of change.&lt;page&gt;A difficult journey you would face, but a choice it can create. Prolong our world&#39;s stasis or face the heart of its infection. </entry>
<entry name="HORNET_GREENPATH">Come no closer, ghost.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve seen you, creeping through the undergrowth, stalking me.&lt;page&gt;This old kingdom... A terrible thing awakens. I can smell it in the air...&lt;page&gt;I know what you are. I know what you&#39;d try to do. I can&#39;t allow it.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_ABYSS_DREAM">...It faced the void, and ascends unscathed... Could it unite such vast darkness?..</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_SPIDER_TOWN_REPEAT">Leave me now, ghost. Allow me a moment alone before this bedchamber becomes forever a shrine.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_ABYSS_REPEAT">I&#39;d urge you to take that harder path, but what end may come, the decision rests with you.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_INSPECT_IK">The remains of a wanderer, long deceased.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_PRE_FINAL_BATTLE_REPEAT">Ghost of Hallownest, you possess the strength to enact an end of your choosing. Would you supplant our birth-cursed sibling, or would you transcend it?</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_PRE_FINAL_BATTLE_DREAM">...Could it achieve that impossible thing? Should it?</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_OUTSKIRTS_DEFEAT">...So strong...&lt;page&gt;You could do it, if you had the will.&lt;page&gt;But could you raise your nail once knowing its tragic conception? And knowing yourself?...&lt;page&gt;Then do it, Ghost of Hallownest! Head onward. Burn that mark upon your shell and claim yourself as King.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_FOUNTAIN_1">Again we meet little ghost.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m normally quite perceptive. You I underestimated, though I&#39;ve since guessed the truth.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ve seen beyond this kingdom&#39;s bounds. Yours is resilience born of two voids.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s no surprise then you&#39;ve managed to reach the heart of this world. In so doing, you shall know the sacrifice that keeps it standing.</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_FOUNTAIN_2">If, knowing that truth, you&#39;d still attempt a role in Hallownest&#39;s perpetuation, seek the Grave in Ash and the mark it would grant to one like you.</entry>
