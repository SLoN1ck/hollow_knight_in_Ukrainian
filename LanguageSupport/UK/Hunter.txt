<entry name="HUNTER_DREAM">It is stronger even than me... does it know that? Will it return to hunt me...? I hope it tries.</entry>
<entry name="GOT_MARK">You have my mark, and you shall be recognised as one of my rare caste. Fellow Hunter, I have nothing else to give you.</entry>
<entry name="HUNTER_ENTRIES_COMPLETED">So, you&#39;ve encountered all of the beasts in this land. Impressive! But one task remains, little squib.&lt;page&gt;Keep hunting down creatures until you have deciphered all of my notes! Only then will I recognise you as my fellow Hunter and you shall receive your reward.</entry>
<entry name="HUNTER_CONVO_1">Little squib! You may have overcome a few creatures, but you are only just beginning.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t delay, descend into the belly of this world and hunt down the life you find!</entry>
<entry name="HUNTER_CONVO_2">Ahhh... I knew I&#39;d seen it right. That hunter&#39;s quality. Hallownest&#39;s creatures fall in your path.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t stop now little squib, many more there are to find, and stalk, and kill. </entry>
<entry name="HUNTER_CONVO_3">Ah ha! Your journal grows fat and full. Only those last few, rare beasts remain left to stalk.&lt;page&gt;Search the kingdom&#39;s corners. Complete the journal. Earn your well deserved reward...</entry>
<entry name="HUNTER_COMPLETE">Your journal... let me see it!&lt;page&gt;Yes... Yes! The Hunter&#39;s journal is complete!&lt;page&gt;You have proven yourself a true hunter, a master of killing, and so with great pleasure I will give you the reward you deserve...</entry>
<entry name="COMPLETE_REPEAT">You have proven yourself a true hunter, a master of killing, and so with great pleasure I will give you the reward you deserve...</entry>
<entry name="GOT_REVISIT">Fellow Hunter. You return? You&#39;ve already proven yourself to me. I&#39;m only biding time a moment, before next my hunt begins.&lt;page&gt;A true Hunter has no home, no kingdom and I&#39;m eager for new prey.&lt;page&gt;You bear the mark now, but that&#39;s only the beginning. That mark will become a part of you, will engrave itself deep within, and that yearning to hunt... It will never leave.</entry>
<entry name="HUNTER_MEET">Tiny squib... You approach fearless. Are you a hunter like me?&lt;page&gt;Do you feel the urge inside, to stalk, to kill, to understand?&lt;page&gt;Then take it! My journal. It will aid you. At first the text may seem difficult to discern, but a learned hunter will come to understand its words.&lt;page&gt;Venture the depths of this land and slay its beasts. Prove yourself worthy to bear the mark of Hunter.</entry>
