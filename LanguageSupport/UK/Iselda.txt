<entry name="ISELDA_GREET1">Of all the places to end up, we&#39;ve picked this dreary town. I&#39;d thought it a temporary stop, then my husband became obsessed with that old ruin.&lt;page&gt;Now he&#39;s spending all his time down there. He argues cartography is sound business, but other than you, who&#39;s buying?</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_TRAMPIN">Apparently Hallownest has giant metal carriages called trams? Sounds unecessary to me, given those old stag lines that Corny always talks about.&lt;page&gt;Still, I&#39;ve made a pin to represent a tram station. Might be useful if you&#39;re inclined to make your map more detailed.&lt;page&gt;It wasn&#39;t too hard to make, so I&#39;m not charging a premium for it.</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_NOSTOCK">After more supplies? You&#39;ve already bought so much. Unfortunately for now, you&#39;ve cleaned us out of anything worth selling.&lt;page&gt;Cornifer will no doubt be pleased, though I do wonder what he plans to spend all that Geo on. </entry>

<entry name="ISELDA_DREAMTREE">My husband mentioned some strange roots that grow about the kingdom and suggested I make a pin to mark them.&lt;page&gt;Cornifer thinks my pin&#39;s depiction look grander than the sad limp thing he comes across, but I figure, that&#39;s not a bad thing. Who&#39;d want to buy a pin of a limp root?</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_CORNIFER_HOME">Cornifer&#39;s home at last, but look at him, he&#39;s exhausted. He always does this, furiously charts a place, then collapses once he&#39;s done.&lt;page&gt;He&#39;ll be sleeping for some time I imagine, so even with him home, I&#39;m still lost for company.&lt;page&gt;Ahhh, but I do love the bug, even his faults. Seeing his passion for maps, it&#39;s something of an inspiration.&lt;page&gt;Corny keeps asking me to join him on his adventures and I&#39;ve always declined. Maybe next time I should accept the offer?</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_MEET">Come to buy a map have you? It&#39;s really my husband you should be dealing with, but what a surprise! He&#39;s headed down below.&lt;page&gt;He&#39;ll pop back occasionally to deliver new maps for the store but I do wish he&#39;d spend a little more time up here. I&#39;ve not much interest in retail myself.&lt;page&gt;Now, let&#39;s see what&#39;s here for me to sell.</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_REPEAT">Are you enjoying yourself down in the ruins? At times my husband makes Hallownest sound a wonder, but sometimes it seems a ghastly, dangerous place.</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_GHOSTPIN">Corny was telling me of some distinctive graves and shrines about the kingdom. I&#39;ve made a new pin to represent them.&lt;page&gt;This one was quite challenging to make, and I laboured over the details. It&#39;s a nice result so I think it&#39;s worth a little more.</entry>
<entry name="ISELDA_DREAM">I&#39;m glad I put down my weapon, this quiet life with Corny makes me a lot happier. It would be nice to stretch my legs again though... sometime soon...</entry>
