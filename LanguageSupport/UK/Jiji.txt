<entry name="MEET2">I am Jiji, and if you have found your way into my chamber you must need my help.&lt;page&gt;You see, sometimes we leave our regrets behind in the world, like black stains.&lt;page&gt;If we don&#39;t deal with these regrets, hope starts to drain from us.&lt;page&gt;Do you have regrets of your own, little one? Let me peer into you for a moment...</entry>
