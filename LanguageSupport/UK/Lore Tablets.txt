<entry name="RANDOM_POEM_STUFF">In wilds beyond they speak your name with reverence and regret,For none could tame our savage souls yet you the challenge met,Under palest watch, you taught, you changed. Base instincts were redeemed,A world you gave to bug and beast as they had never dreamed.                                                          - Excerpt from Ode to Hallownest by Monomon the TeacherOur cherished dreams you granted and delivered more,But in dismay you found too late our desires had no end,What cost to tame our savagery? You gave your all and then gave more.Yet still desires lay unquenched, more dreams remained, your energies spent.Amongst it sprang a dreadful scourge,that forced return our aggressive urge,and turned us back to beasts or husks,Our souls consumed by light above.Within your corpse can still be heard the plaintiff cries of one,Who took our pain, and loss, and dreams inside itself to...Through it&#39; pain we found a truth that must now be confessed,For nothing can contain such things but perfect emptiness.</entry>
