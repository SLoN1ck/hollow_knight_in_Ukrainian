<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK">It sees the face beneath! Or could it be just another mask?&lt;page&gt;Truth in Hallownest is always buried deep. How many layers will it pry through?</entry>
<entry name="JINN_TALK_GENERIC">...Does It wish to trade? If trade is desired, step before Jinn and trade can commence.</entry>
<entry name="KING_FINAL_WORDS">...Soul of Wyrm. Soul of Root. Heart of Void...</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_UNDERGROUND_DREAM">Where will the line of Hallownest&#39;s Great Knights end? With me? Can such a thing be passed on?</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_DEFENDER_DREAM">...So there were others...</entry>
<entry name="MINER_DREAM_2">... how much longer... KILL IT... how much longer... DANGEROUS... how much longer... KILL IT... how much longer... KILL THE EMPTY ONE...&lt;page&gt;...how much longer... must I dig...?</entry>

<entry name="JINN_RETURN">...It came back. Does it remember Jinn? Will It offer a gift? Trade for useless shinies?</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_CONVO1">You don&#39;t like to be hurt, do you? Or... maybe you don&#39;t mind...?</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_CONVO2">Are you nice? If you&#39;re nice you&#39;ll give me Geo.&lt;page&gt;Maybe you aren&#39;t so nice...? Don&#39;t try to trick me... I&#39;m not stupid.</entry>
<entry name="JINN_TALK_03">It likes Jinn&#39;s shinies? Jinn has many... many. Gifts, from another, helped by Jinn. Hurt by Jinn.&lt;page&gt;Jinn did not want shinies. Only clutter. Mess. But can trade, for gift.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK2">Has it witnessed that truth most tragic? The Wyrm&#39;s great shame sealed away.&lt;page&gt;Now this Kingdom&#39;s stasis becomes the Wyrm&#39;s legacy.</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_CONVO5">Are you curious? You&#39;re wondering... how I make my special gifts.&lt;page&gt;Eeeauuggh! Don&#39;t try to steal my secrets! I&#39;ll steal them right back.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;re cruel to me... you&#39;ll be sorry. </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK4">I see another takes mantle of king? Then grim responsibility that shall bestow.&lt;page&gt;No bug has ever laid claim to this whole. Even the beasts knew their limits and bound their realm at Nest&#39;s edge.&lt;page&gt;It is the ancient caste that made attempt at such vast rule. Hallownest&#39;s ruin reflects well those fared attempts.</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_REFUSE_AGAIN">Still?! You&#39;re a greedy, nasty little wretch. You need to share your Geo...</entry>
<entry name="TUK_GREET">Mmmnnnnnnngghhh... The water brings me everything I wish for... I just need to find it.&lt;page&gt;It brought you here, too. Are you hungry? I&#39;ll share my food with you... if you give me Geo.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_REOFFER">Me&#39;hon? Does the heart beat a moment? Share pain of grief and hope to soothe it?&lt;page&gt;Would you convey che&#39;s final gift unto her lover&#39;s grave? </entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_QG_GREET">Ahhh tiny warrior. Then, you too come to test yourself against that traitorous tribe?&lt;page&gt;A deadly bunch they are that roost within these glades. I&#39;d once&#39;ve stayed well clear of them, but your actions have shown me the truth of it. We must face down our fears or be defeated by them.&lt;page&gt;If we both make it through, we can swap stories of our adventures. I&#39;d look forward to that!</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_TALK_EXTRA">Do I seem prisoner here? If so, it&#39;s not by any choice but my own. These bindings about me, I&#39;ve chosen to erect.&lt;page&gt;There is some shame I feel from my own part in the deed and this method guarantees it cease.&lt;page&gt;I still feel that urge you see. I always will. A voracious desire to spread seeds upon the land, to propogate myself, to breed.</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_DIARY_ZOTE">                         The Grey Prince&lt;br&gt;Heaving heavy breaths, flush from the exertion of battle, the figure emerged from the well. Triumph was his and trophy he bore to prove it, the fearsome skull of his vanquished opponent.&lt;page&gt;Startling warning he brought to the village, one that rung so true: the white saviour, thought a hero by the bugs, was a vicious beast and this shrouded grey prince was in truth the hero deserved.&lt;page&gt;With honour and humility he recounted his quest below, his epic journey of one purpose, to find her, to protect her, his grey maiden, his partner in darkness...</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_TOWN_DREAM">Nola, I&#39;m coming. More challenging foes are out there, somewhere, but none in this ruin could take me to you...</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_FUNG_REPEAT">Keep sharp my adventurous friend. Stay alive and let&#39;s meet again on the road ahead.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_REFUSE">You turn away? Che&#39; should&#39;ve expected such. This world is not one of favours. Only of heart-ache.</entry>
<entry name="MINER_INFECTED">...Bury my body... c-cover my shell,&lt;br&gt;What meaning in darkness? Yet here I remain...&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll wait here forever...till light blooms again...</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_TRAMWAY_SAVED">Enough! I cannot wallow in my weakness. I must take strength from your example!&lt;page&gt;You act so confident in battle. You show no fear before your foes. I&#39;ll try my best to do the same.</entry>
<entry name="TISO_TOWN_REPEAT">Hallownest... What challengers await in its ruin?</entry>
<entry name="GIRAFFE_UPPER">Mmmf, delicious.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_FAILED2">.....Wai. Destroyed. Again. Another rare and precious thing reduced to wilted stem.&lt;page&gt;Che&#39; does have spare...But Le&#39;mer must know, a precious, sacred fragile flower it is. She did not want to part with it, but for meled&#39;love, she would give all. Woulds&#39;t that quest again be taken?</entry>
<entry name="JINN_TALK_01">...Does It want to know of Jinn?...&lt;page&gt;Jinn, little know... cannot tell of self. Too young, its thought, its mind. Born to provide, to trade.&lt;page&gt;Will help, to trade, yes?... Bring Jinn gift. Wonderful gift.</entry>
<entry name="JINN_TALK_02">...Its body, so soft... Fragile... Inferior built. Not like Jinn.&lt;page&gt;Jinn, does not take... hurt. Jinn shall last.</entry>
<entry name="MINER_EARLY_1">Oh, hello again! Are you still running about? Why not join me d-down here? There&#39;s plenty of wealth in these rocks for anyone willing to put a bit of work in!&lt;page&gt;Those crystals out there are worth a fair b-b-bit, but I have a feeling that there&#39;s something even more valuable hidden just a bit deeper in! I can almost smell it! Ha ha ha!</entry>
<entry name="MINER_EARLY_2">Ohh, bury the knight with her broken nail,&lt;br&gt;bury the lady, lovely and pale!&lt;br&gt;Bury the priest in his tattered gown,&lt;br&gt;then bury the beggar with his shining croooown!</entry>
<entry name="MINER_EARLY_3">This is hard work, but I don&#39;t mind. Down here, I can k-keep working without even sleeping. It&#39;s fun!&lt;page&gt;And every once in a while you c-c-come to visit me! I&#39;m glad... ha ha... I&#39;m glad you like the sound of my voice!</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_REPEAT">Faces I grant to all who&#39;d request. Not task for I, but aid, gift to a world deserving.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_TRAMWAY_DREAM_SAD">I could only hide. What warrior am I?..</entry>
<entry name="MINER_DREAM_1">I&#39;m so close... Keep singing, crystals! Keep singing so I can find you!&lt;page&gt;Keep whispering, crystals! I can almost hear what you&#39;re saying!</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_GREET">Is it mask or face upon the creature? In Hallownest, a difficult thing it can be to decipher.</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_FINAL2">Until our paths cross again...</entry>
<entry name="TUK_DUNG">Mmnnnnggghhh...? Your smell... Are you a friend, too? If you&#39;re a friend, I&#39;ll share my food with you.&lt;page&gt;When you see him again, our friend... tell him thank you. For helping me.</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_DUNG">Eeeauuggh! That smell you carry with you...&lt;page&gt;Ah! Ah! Ahhhhh!&lt;page&gt;...Very tasty!&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re sweet... to share such a tasty smell with me. Do you want a gift in return?&lt;page&gt;Cheaper... Yes. My beautiful gifts... I&#39;ll give them to you. Cheaper.</entry>
<entry name="TISO_DREAM_COLOSSEUM">...The perfect challenge. I can already taste my victory...</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_DEFENDER_SLEEP_DREAM">...Isma... So strong.... Teach me...</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_TOWN_REPEAT">I&#39;ll be off soon. It&#39;s a dangerous thing to trek the desolate sands beyond the kingdom. I&#39;ll need all my strength to survive them.&lt;page&gt;First though, a good rest is in order.</entry>
<entry name="MINER_EARLY_1_B">You&#39;re welcome to join me, there&#39;s enough for both of us! Or if you don&#39;t feel like d-d-d-digging, you can just sit and sing with me! Ha ha ha!</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_MEET">Oh! One arrives. Far it walks to find me. Did it seek my aid? Or did the path carry it by chance to so pertinant a place?&lt;page&gt;It is true. True, that you were awaited. No. Perhaps that is inaccurate. True one like you was awaited.&lt;page&gt;I have a gift, held long for one of your kind. Half of a whole. When united, great power is granted, and on the path ahead, great power it will need.</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_UNDERGROUND_1">Ahh, you&#39;re awake, and looking well-rested!&lt;page&gt;I was startled when I woke to find you curled up beside me, but of course you&#39;re welcome to rest here whenever the world wearies you.&lt;page&gt;As the King granted his kingdom, to shelter to those who needed it, I offer my home. Stay as long as you like, down here where it&#39;s cosy and warm and moist.</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_UNDERGROUND_2">My cave may seem a far cry from the finery of the palace but even still the memories of my former comrades, and our glorious King, remain fresh in my mind.&lt;page&gt;The Pale Court was a wondrous place full of the age&#39;s greatest heroes. Ahh! Looking at you now, I can easily imagine you standing amongst them. </entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_GHOST_REPEAT">Be on my way soon. Nola is waiting and I&#39;m done down here. Just savouring the moment a little longer. </entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_PAID">Let me show you then... take a look. Do you want them? If you really, really want them, I&#39;ll trade them... for more Geo. More Geo.</entry>
<entry name="BIGCAT_SHADECHARM">Ohhhmmmm... Tiny thing... It evolves beyond that Wyrm. Such union in a single being. A strength before unseen. Would it too challenge nature? It could perhaps defeat it.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_DEEPNEST_MEET">Greetings tiny creature. You got the look of an adventurer alright. I&#39;d call myself the same but this dreadful place makes me feel inadequate.</entry>
<entry name="JINN_KING_BRAND">...A King, the tiny It becomes. Jinn knows that mark, but cannot bow.&lt;page&gt;Jinn&#39;s masters are other... minds other... Not order. Not order, they seek.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_LOCKED">Not so fast! That trial is closed to those without the proper experience. Try one of the other trials first.</entry>
<entry name="JINN_ACCEPT_REPEAT">...Another horrible... disgusting gift. Jinn will keep gift for... Friend of Jinn... and It shall have shinies. That is trade...</entry>
<entry name="SPIDER_GREET2">My good friend. You wear that bright mark of relationship. Then you&#39;ve met her perhaps? Her who&#39;d guard the mark, the Gendered Child.&lt;page&gt;A spritely thing, isn&#39;t she? Pale gift to the Nest and the Beast, and fair trade for sacrifice made.&lt;page&gt;Long she&#39;s been distant. It&#39;d do our spirits well were she to grace us a visit home...&lt;page&gt;...He hee. Oh. Hmm. I am sorry. Old memories cause my mind to wander on such silly diversions, especially when I&#39;m oh so famished...</entry>
<entry name="WHITE_DEFENDER_OUTRO_2">My King... I believe in you. I believe in Hallownest! My devotion will never falter...</entry>
<entry name="TISO_BENCH_REPEAT">Leave me be. It&#39;s the arena I seek. I&#39;ve already wasted far too long on these cursed roads.</entry>
<entry name="WHITE_DEFENDER_OUTRO_4">My King... We will all be together once more...</entry>
<entry name="WHITE_DEFENDER_OUTRO_5">How funny that I see you in my dreams too, little one. Your noble bearing reminds me of our dear King. When he returns, I&#39;ll ask him if you can become a Knight! What jolly adventures we will have...</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK3">To change a face; to conceal it fully within another... A powerful protection that is, but one with sad consequence.&lt;page&gt;The original mind is destroyed, though those of striking will may still retain a sliver of that concealed self.</entry>
<entry name="SPIDER_GREET">Ahh! It returns. I do apologise about before. Heehee. No matter. No matter. My appetite oft gets the better of me. For now at least, I&#39;m content.&lt;page&gt;Would you hear about myself? There&#39;s not so much to say. I&#39;m a servant to the nest, though few in recent times would seek my service.&lt;page&gt;Our brood is lost to that pestilence of the mind. A sad fall for the most intelligent species. &lt;page&gt;Ah, but hmmm. I&#39;ve eaten yes, and full. Then again, another little morsel would make me oh so happy. The perfect end to a meal...</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_DEEPNEST_DREAM">Such bad luck. The critters about here are just terrifying. Those scuttling legs, those gnashing teeth.&lt;page&gt;Tis not the end I&#39;d ever want to meet.  </entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_DREAM">Lord Fool, give me another chance. I&#39;ll prove my strength to you!</entry>
<entry name="XUN_DREAM">Ulll... Nemenoo... Nails and claws... Why must it be so?</entry>
<entry name="EMILITIA_KING_BRAND">Oh... hmm... Could it be? You&#39;ve returned at last? No. No... &lt;page&gt;Oh pardon me! For just a moment, I mistook a certain quality about you. You seemed almost... regal. &lt;page&gt;Silly, I know. It&#39;s clear you&#39;re not of high birth, wandering about all dirty and tattered like that. </entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_NOTENOUGH">Ah, you lack the Geo to make a contribution. We can&#39;t make an exception, I&#39;m afraid. Return once you are worthier... and wealthier.</entry>
<entry name="SPIDER_MEET">Oh. Please. Please. Don&#39;t be shy. There are some nasties about here alright. Not me. I&#39;m a friend to all and happy to serve a traveller so bold as you.&lt;page&gt;Is it information you seek? That I can provide. Yes. Oh yes. Heehee.&lt;page&gt;That village above here, home to a sad creature. Hers is a tale of tragic exchange. Cost her and her people greatly, though I suspect she bore no regret in making it. &lt;page&gt;Heehee, yes. I know. I know. You&#39;re intrigued. You want to know the tale. Well I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;d love to tell it, but I&#39;m just, I&#39;m very, very sorry, and I haven&#39;t eaten in some time...&lt;page&gt;And oh, I&#39;m STAA-AARVING...</entry>
<entry name="JINN_REFUSE">...It refuses to trade...? It has a will... all Its own. Can refuse. Jinn will keep waiting... until a gift comes.</entry>
<entry name="BIGCAT_TAIL_HIT">Is it you bothering about my tail? Rest is somewhat disturbed, but I find that sensation not unpleasant..Ohr..Ohr...Ohrmm.</entry>
<entry name="TISO_SHIELD">You think this shell a defensive arm? Well I&#39;ll give you fair warning, it conceals a deadly surprise. Pray you never find out what that is.</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_MEET_REPEAT">Prepare well, but don&#39;t dally. Were the Vessel to break prematurely, that plague would unleash with rage and power built of ages chained.</entry>
<entry name="GIRAFFE_LOWER">This place must once have been quite the hub, built at the border between two lands, that misty drop to one side and those bulbous growths another. &lt;page&gt;Neither place seems particularly welcoming so while my little treats last, I think I&#39;ll stay right here.</entry>
<entry name="JINN_OFFER">...Would It offer gift so wonderful to Jinn...?</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_DREAM">...Wyrms pull bugs into their thrall,&lt;br&gt;Till ages pass and kingdoms fall,&lt;page&gt;Caps and shells may fall to dust,&lt;br&gt;But Mr Mushroom readjusts...</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_EXCUSE">...Oh. Excuse me.</entry>
<entry name="TUK_DECLINE">Mngh? If you don&#39;t want it, I&#39;ll keep it.</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_DEFENDER_REPEAT">Go now, mighty warrior of Hallownest! You&#39;ve proven your honour! Good fortune on the path ahead.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_REOFFER2">Woulds&#39;t you perhaps attempt the journey to che&#39;s lover&#39;s grave again?</entry>
<entry name="TISO_DREAM_TOWN">This little squib clearly fears me. I&#39;d kill it right here, but it&#39;d be too pitiful an end.</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_BROKEN">Eeeauuggh! You broke it! I gave you that charm as a gift, and you broke it! Clumsy little fool... Nasty.&lt;page&gt;Apologise, ask me nicely, and I&#39;ll fix it for you. Give me Geo and I&#39;ll fix it for you.</entry>
<entry name="GIRAFFE_UPPER_REPEAT">Mmmmmm, just splendid.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_GRAVE_FLOWER">Placed flower</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_DEFENDER_DUNG_CHARM">Ahh. You exude the proud odour of the Just. Truly, a mighty Knight you are. </entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_TRAMWAY_REPEAT">I look forward to our next contact, tiny saviour. Then you&#39;ll meet a warrior with courage to match your own. </entry>
<entry name="TISO_COLOSSEUM_REPEAT">I&#39;ll crush them all. Oh, and you. You&#39;ll see me at my deadly best.</entry>
<entry name="MOSS_CULTIST_01">Oooohhh radiant being, we are blessed. Your rays touch us. Your warmth fills us.&lt;page&gt;Hallownest is born again, united in your blazing image. Oohhh...</entry>
<entry name="MOSS_CULTIST_02">Light is life, beaming, pure, brilliant. To stifle that light is to suppress nature.&lt;page&gt;Nature suppressed distorts, plagues us. Embrace light! Achieve union! Oohh..Ahhh. </entry>
<entry name="GIRAFFE_MEET">Oh! Come in search of treats have you? I chanced upon a unique little fungus growing right above us. I&#39;ve found it only in this station and the taste is just divine. </entry>
<entry name="XUN_HAVE_FLOWER2">Her grave lies in the middle of the Queen&#39;s old retreat. It&#39;s a far journey from here and you&#39;ve already learned how dangerous those paths can be.&lt;page&gt;Be safe...And be more careful. Me&#39;hon.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_TOWN_GREET">Ah! Tiny warrior. I&#39;m glad I could see you again. You&#39;ve inspired me! I&#39;m about to head off in search of other places and other foes.&lt;page&gt;This quiet town&#39;s the perfect stop before I scale the cliffs and head out onto the plains.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_CHAMP">A true fool keeps on fighting, even when there is no more glory to be gained. Step over to a board and make your mark! Show us how foolish you truly are!</entry>
<entry name="GIRAFFE_DREAM">This little creature looks tasty. I wonder, should I eat it? The others around here were awfully bland.</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_DREAM">So it can access a mind? Then the seals shall break before its blade. </entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_CONVO3">Beautiful, aren&#39;t they? These gifts I have... they&#39;re shiny and dangerous and lovely.&lt;page&gt;I made them. Don&#39;t be jealous... Give me Geo and you can have one.</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_CONVO4">Hmm. The air has changed, I can smell something new. Dangerous things are drifting through here now... are you scared?&lt;page&gt;If you stay here... I won&#39;t protect you.</entry>
<entry name="WHITE_DEFENDER_OUTRO_3">My King... Hallownest will be reborn! Glorious and bright! Just as it always was...</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_DEFENDER_1">Oh, it&#39;s you again. I&#39;m glad to see you return.&lt;page&gt;No, no, please... Don&#39;t say a word. I must apologise for my previous behaviour.&lt;page&gt;Entirely my fault. I mistook you for one of those mindless skulking husks, yet you bested me in the most majestic knightly fashion.</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_DEFENDER_2">Such joyful, vigorous combat. I&#39;d almost forgotten the feeling.&lt;page&gt;I was once a Knight you see. By the grace of our good King, I stood proudly before the throne, watching Hallownest swell to greatness.&lt;page&gt;Then that nasty business with the affliction...</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_DEFENDER_3">We knights defend against the physical, but a formless enemy. How to defeat such a foe?&lt;page&gt;Our King tried in his own way. A cruel means it was... And still, eventually, we were brought low.&lt;page&gt;Bah! I shouldn&#39;t be so morose. You&#39;ve invigorated me. Tis&#39; truly a delight to meet one whose strength can match my own.</entry>
<entry name="TISO_DREAM_BENCH">Those old stags could&#39;ve been ferocious fighters. If only they weren&#39;t so servile...</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_MEET">Don&#39;t try to sneak past me. I can smell you.&lt;page&gt;Hmm... Do you collect a lot of Geo?&lt;page&gt;Give me Geo, and you can see something... nice.</entry>
<entry name="BIGCAT_TALK_01">This falling ash is moult. The Wyrm&#39;s corpse decaying. Endless. Rmm... Serene. Sad.&lt;page&gt;With its like gone, the world is smaller.</entry>
<entry name="BIGCAT_TALK_02">Don&#39;t mistake. I am not a wyrm... Ohrm... Too small, I am. Too many limbs. No foresight like those old things. </entry>
<entry name="BIGCAT_TALK_03">For quiet retreat did I climb up here, away from spitting creatures. Ormmph... Yes. High up. Away from simple minds, lost to light.&lt;page&gt;Theirs is a different kind of unity. Rejection of the Wyrm&#39;s attempt at order.&lt;page&gt;I resist the light&#39;s allure. Union it may offer, but also a mind bereft of thought... To instinct alone a bug is reduced...Hrrm...</entry>
<entry name="KING_ABYSS_04">No voice to cry suffering.</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_DREAM_ZOTE">Heroic...Beautiful...</entry>
<entry name="TISO_LAKE_REPEAT">So peaceful. So dull.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_REFUSE">You won&#39;t make a contribution? No one ever won glory by clinging to their Geo...</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_DIED">What is this? I could&#39;ve sworn you&#39;d already entered the fray? And were killed in spectacular fashion, but now... I can&#39;t be sure.&lt;page&gt;Must&#39;ve imagined it. I do tend to visualise new combatant&#39;s meeting their end. It&#39;s good training for the mind, especially whilst your movement&#39;s somewhat limited.</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_NOSTOCK">I&#39;ve got nothing left to show you. Do you want something more?&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re so greedy...</entry>
<entry name="KING_ABYSS_FINAL">You shall seal the blinding light that plagues their dreams.&lt;page&gt;You are the Vessel.&lt;page&gt;You are the Hollow Knight.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_GRAVE_INSPECT">Here sleeps the Traitors&#39; child.</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_ZOTE">Grey Prince...So dark...So troubled...</entry>
<entry name="SPA_DUO_DREAM">Another weak one. I&#39;d suggest it try its nail within the colosseum, though it&#39;d no doubt be squashed in an instant.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_ACCEPT2">Then this new, sacred, one of its kind flower che&#39; shall give you. As che warned before, it doest become precious as one&#39;s heart whilst held.&lt;page&gt;If you were to get hurt again whilst carrying it, or did to attempt ride those jolting transit beasts, this one too shall be destroyed.&lt;page&gt;Though my faith in one has been...challenged, my hopes are still with you Le&#39;mer. </entry>
<entry name="XUN_MEET">Ahhhh.... Me&#39;hon. This world. This cruel, sinful world. Why does che&#39; wake? Why does che&#39; persist?&lt;page&gt;Ahhh Le&#39;mer, you could not know of tragedy as complete as che&#39;s, true lovers stripped apart, two worlds that could not meet.&lt;page&gt;And now meled&#39;lover, dead so long in time. Dead, so far away. Buried, moina? Ai. Amongst its hateful kin that did deny our union, that did reject che&#39;s... outside-ness.&lt;page&gt;She doesn&#39;t suppose?... Nahlo, Nahlo. Could che&#39; ask? Could che&#39; burden?&lt;page&gt;Le&#39;mer, woulds&#39;t you, coulds&#39;t you deliver gift to her grave?&lt;page&gt;The gift is, maybe small? But the trek is long. She rests amongst her kind near our Queen&#39;s lush refuge.&lt;page&gt;Would such a thing be done? Che&#39; asks perhaps impossible things? Mad things? For Le&#39;mer to take up such quest would be a kindness che&#39; has near forgotten. </entry>
<entry name="BIGCAT_KING_BRAND">Tiny thing... Oh hmm... The mark of Wyrm you bear. Is it change you seek? Or to save this ruin?&lt;page&gt;That choice is yours. Always the smallest creatures that attempts the largest things.</entry>
<entry name="TUK_NOTENOUGH">Why don&#39;t you have enough Geo?!&lt;page&gt;Mnnghh! I won&#39;t share my food if you can&#39;t give me Geo.</entry>
<entry name="TUK_BUY">Mnngh... this Geo is mine now. Don&#39;t try to take it back.&lt;page&gt;Here, take your food with you when you leave.</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_RESCUE_1">Ohhh... please... don&#39;t leave me behind!&lt;page&gt;You... forgot about me...? I knew you would... everyone always forgets about me...</entry>
<entry name="JINN_DREAM">Does Jinn dream?... What purpose, mine?... To serve, enough?</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_RESCUE_3">I-I&#39;m sorry. I got lost, I don&#39;t know how I ended up here.&lt;page&gt;I... you came here to rescue me, Bretta? The girl that everyone just... ignores?</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_RESCUE_4">Sorry, when I look at your face I can hardly... I just can&#39;t believe you came all the way down here to rescue me. I didn&#39;t think anybody...&lt;page&gt;Sorry... I mean, thank you. I mean... I&#39;d better go. Back to town I mean. I&#39;d better get home...</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_RESCUE_5">Th... thank you.</entry>

<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_FINAL">...Oh. I see. So you&#39;ve been following me around then? I hope my travels haven&#39;t confused your own, distracted you.&lt;page&gt;Then again, a meandered journey still has meaning. It is, after all, from a journey we find our purpose, though a stop is more than just a stop.&lt;page&gt;And my if those stops can&#39;t be lovely things, wouldn&#39;t you say? Transcendant plateaus, distant sandy lands, vast ancient kingdoms. Yours was not the first, nor will it be the last, but it&#39;s a unique and special thing nonetheless.&lt;page&gt;Now, with my duties here finished, it&#39;s time I made graceful departure. Till next time my friend. Tis a long road we tread, but a joyous one.</entry>

<entry name="QUEEN_DUNG_02">Dear Ogrim, I&#39;m sure you saw Dryya on the way in? She&#39;s stood guard over me for so long.&lt;page&gt;Despite her hard front, she&#39;s always been a caring type. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll much enjoy a Knights&#39; reunion.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_CHALLENGE">You&#39;ve placed your mark, and the great gate has opened. Go on! Step into the Colosseum and cut your way to victory.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_FAILED">Ulll Waaaaii! Che&#39;s sacred, precious, one of its kind flower. Ruined. Che&#39;s love, denied her final gift. Such suffering for che&#39;. Such misery. Che&#39; thought she could bear no more.&lt;page&gt;...I suppose, che&#39; does have one more flower though.&lt;page&gt;But Le&#39;mer! This one is equally sacred and equally fragile. Where&#39;st one to accept such quest, it must become mel&#39;precious heart. Would such a thing be again be tried?</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_GHOST">Well now that was something! A true battle of mighty warriors. So intense. So climactic. It&#39;s really everything I could have ever hoped for.&lt;page&gt;Thanks for all your help, my friend. For a tiny bug you set a valiant example. We&#39;ll meet again, I&#39;m sure of it. </entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_DIARY_2">                         The White Saviour Returns&lt;br&gt;Long had they remained apart and the village, once so warm, now grew cold. The maiden felt the well of grief. It gripped fierce about her lonely shell.&lt;page&gt;And suddenly, as though her tragic state was sensed, the saviour returned, standing tall, glowing bright. Below shining horns, eyes welled black, glistening, eyes only for the maiden long missed, long desired.&lt;page&gt;Her saviour leaned close, sat beside, perfectly composed. In that charged, breathless moment not a word needed be spoken, &lt;page&gt;The maiden&#39;s shell felt suddenly tight. Her claws curled. No glance was shared, no claws touched, just perfect, aching love shared in silence, together...</entry>
<entry name="XUN_SUCCESS1">Mi&#39;? Le&#39;mer, you have done this thing? Is it possible? This world&#39;s cruelty, I&#39;d thought it overwhelming, but le&#39;mer, such great compassion. That Che&#39;s love would know her partner&#39;s heart even aeon past.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_SUCCESS2">Is it that, Le&#39;mer? Such grief, can end? Che&#39; can end?&lt;page&gt;Ullll, eh nai dear love. Che&#39; too can end.</entry>
<entry name="EMILITIA_MEET">Ah, what a surprise! It&#39;s not often I receive visitors. It&#39;s been so long. Ages even. I just hope my manners haven&#39;t left me.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ve no doubt sensed my affluence. You&#39;re right to guess, I&#39;m renowned amongst the upper caste of Hallownest.&lt;page&gt;...Well I was... once, until those cretins cast me out.&lt;page&gt;Have you met them, my former fellows? That&#39;s them outside, their bodies shambling around all mindless and empty. And I&#39;m still alive to witness their pathetic demise.&lt;page&gt;Ahhh, I&#39;m just so happy. Fate can be a wonderful thing.</entry>
<entry name="EMILITIA_REPEAT">Isn&#39;t life just wonderful...</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_DEEPNEST_GREET">This whole area swarms with deadly critters, biting, burning, scratching types. I&#39;d thought to test my strength against them. Now that bravado has left me and all I feel is tired and sore.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_GREET">Welcome back, warrior!</entry>
<entry name="WHITE_DEFENDER_OUTRO_1a">My friends... I will protect our dear Kingdom. Have faith in me!</entry>
<entry name="WHITE_DEFENDER_OUTRO_1b">We will all meet again. I promise it...</entry>
<entry name="XUN_KING_BRAND">Le&#39;mer, takes that heavy mantle...Che&#39; wouldn&#39;t wish it upon one. Having served that brand at its great height, che&#39; knows well what suffering it brings. Enough to turn nym&#39;King to flee or fair Knights to mourning.</entry>
<entry name="GIRAFFE_LOWER_REPEAT">Feel free to stop by anytime. Though I do like the quiet in this station, a little company is always good for one&#39;s health.</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_DREAM">I&#39;ll make more... and they&#39;ll give me more Geo. If someone comes by, they have to give me their Geo.&lt;page&gt;If you have enough Geo, you become a king. When I get enough Geo, I&#39;ll become a king...</entry>
<entry name="EMILITIA_DREAM">No doubt this one will meet its demise at the nails of the city&#39;s guards. I&#39;ll outlive you too little grub, as I did all the others.</entry>
<entry name="TISO_LAKE_GREET">Garrgh. What a calm place. It&#39;s action I want, vicious and deadly battle. This serenity is a bore.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_FUNG_DREAM">Am I in over my head? Even these shroom creatures almost did me in and far nastier things await further down.&lt;page&gt;Curse me and my foolish bravado! If I could shed my pride, I&#39;d be asking this tiny warrior for help. </entry>
<entry name="BIGCAT_DREAM">One prefers its mind not be pried. Is rather unsettling. Rather invasive.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT">A wonderful thing to have, a face. Not a thing with which we all are blessed. </entry>
<entry name="JINN_NOEGG">...A problem. It did not bring the gift Jinn wants. No trade can occur... None.&lt;page&gt;...Will It seek out the gift Jinn wants? The horrible... round... disgusting gift? Will It return? Jinn will be waiting...</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_SHROOMISH1">Nyush oola mumu? Shruba dungo ola, ola mu... gungi.</entry>
<entry name="BIGCAT_INTRO">Ohrm... Tiny thing. You climb high. Seek then knowledge of these lands?&lt;page&gt;This ashen place is grave of Wyrm. Once told, it came to die. But what is death for that ancient being? More transformation methinks.&lt;page&gt;This failed kingdom is product of the being spawned from that event.</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_REPEAT_SHADECHARM">That pulsing emptiness... Truly, it has been transformed by the revelations it found.&lt;page&gt;Does it... feel anything? Triumph? Or hate? If it does, I cannot sense it.&lt;page&gt;The fate of our Kingdom, our Hallownest... that future belongs to you now.</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_HORNET">It faced the Gendered Child? She&#39;s a fierce foe, strong in mind and body, striking reflection of her mother, though the two were permitted little time together.&lt;page&gt;I never begrudged the Wyrm&#39;s dalliance as bargain. In fact, I feel some affection for the creature birthed.&lt;page&gt;If your paths were ever to align, I imagine you might gain yourself a powerful ally.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_TRAMWAY_DREAM_HAPPY">Such luck! This tiny one appears at just the right moment. And what masterful skill it shows!&lt;page&gt;As a warrior it sets powerful precedent. I&#39;d do well to learn from its form.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_MEET">Aha! Another warrior finds their way to our fair Colosseum. Ours is the final destination for all seeking trials of intense and deadly combat.&lt;page&gt;All one has to do is place their mark upon their Trial Board of choice and lo! The arena&#39;s gate will open.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s a small fee attached to each trial, but I&#39;m sure as skilled a combatant as yourself will have accrued a wealth of Geo.&lt;page&gt;Now, before you draw your nail and rush eagerly to battle, I&#39;ll offer one quick word of advice.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s a warriors&#39; pit just below here, where others like yourself await their own trials. I&#39;d strongly advise using it to rest up before placing your mark.&lt;page&gt;Oh and have no doubt, I&#39;m a fearsome warrior myself. Don&#39;t go judging me by my size, or my current... errr... constraint. The Colosseum beckons us both! I&#39;ll be back in battle soon.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_PAID">Very well then, a new trial is open to you. I hope your performance is spectacular...</entry>
<entry name="MINER_MEET_1">Ohhh, bury my mother, pale and slight,&lt;br&gt;bury my father with his eyes shut tight!&lt;br&gt;Bury my sisters two by two,&lt;br&gt;and then when you&#39;re done, let&#39;s bury me toooo!</entry>
<entry name="TISO_COLOSSEUM">Pale one. You found it too then, this perfect place. I&#39;ll soon be entering the battle. Just taking a moment to rest first.&lt;page&gt;Though few could truly challenge me, I&#39;m hoping this arena presents the sort of brutal challenge I&#39;m after.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_TRAMWAY_GREET">My friend, you dealt with all of those beasts?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m ashamed to say... I was hiding. Those ghastly things chased me and I ran. If you hadn&#39;t come along, who knows if I&#39;d ever have survived.&lt;page&gt;Others take me for a fearsome warrior, what with my impressive size, but this kingdom&#39;s beasts, I wonder if I&#39;m just no match for them?...</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_DUNG">...That scent. Does another travel with you? Is that you Ogrim, my mighty Knight?&lt;page&gt;I cannot see you, but then time has clouded my eyes and I cannot see much. Even your booming voice falls silent upon me.&lt;page&gt;Only this small one I register, if maybe because it shares some piece of myself. This one stands clear upon a misted world.&lt;page&gt;Ah.... But my my, that potent smell does recall such joyous memory. Only a short moment we had together, compared to ruin now endured, but what shining times they were.&lt;page&gt;I am grateful you would visit, even if to see me in somewhat faded form.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_FUNG_MEET">Ah ha! The tiny steps of a tiny creature. You got the look of an adventurer, so we&#39;ve much in common.&lt;page&gt;Searching for dangerous places aye? Well you&#39;re on the right track.&lt;page&gt;A long necked critter warned me of a tribe deeper down. Warrior sorts, so she says and I&#39;m itching for some serious combat.</entry>
<entry name="TISO_TOWN_GREET">Pale thing. You wear that nail with ease. If you&#39;re in search of combat, you&#39;ll find no great warriors in this decaying burrow. &lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve heard an arena exists somewhere below. One built for our like. Meet me there and we&#39;ll test what skills you possess.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ll be heading down soon. Come and find me if you dare.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_HAVE_FLOWER">Her grave lies in the middle of the Queen&#39;s old retreat, a far journey from here and the roads between are fraught with beasts.&lt;page&gt;Safe tiding on your journey. My heart does flutter to feel such kindness from so tiny a creature.</entry>
<entry name="MOSS_CULTIST_DREAM">...Blinding...Rising...Never be empty...</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_QG_DREAM">It&#39;s time! I&#39;ll face that fear. Nola will be proud.</entry>
<entry name="MOSS_CULTIST_DREAM_INFECTED">...Blazing...Bright...</entry>
<entry name="JINN_MEET">...Is It... here, waking Jinn?..&lt;page&gt;Observed... Small. Dull. No Soul. Long shadow... It is blank, but brave...&lt;page&gt;Does it bring offering?&lt;page&gt;Jinn, has only many small, shiny things... useless to Jinn, but will trade for wonderful gift.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_MARK">To enter a trial, step over to the board and place your mark. From that point on, your destiny is your own...</entry>
<entry name="TISO_BENCH_GREET">Ehh. Pale thing. You use these old lines? Pathetic. A real warrior carries himself to combat. He has no need for such convenience.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_OFFER_1">Make a contribution, and you can enter the Trial of the Warrior.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_OFFER_2">Make a contribution, and you can enter the Trial of the Conqueror.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_OFFER_3">Make a contribution, and you can enter the Trial of the Fool.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT2">For this kingdom&#39;s faceless, I shall provide. </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT3">A mask! A face! Does it need one? Does it not? To define. To focus. To exist.</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_DREAM_DAZED">...Shining figure...So bright...</entry>
<entry name="JINN_SHADE_CHARM">This It... A rare It. Has not seen many, so vulnerable, but triumphant. Makes Jinn feel a thing... surprise?&lt;page&gt;Jinn misjudged... The It is not inferior. Perhaps... different? Different to Jinn. More complete? Different... like masters?</entry>
<entry name="JONN_NOEGG_REPEAT">...Will It seek out the gift Jinn wants? The horrible... round... disgusting gift? Will It return? Jinn will be waiting...</entry>
<entry name="TUK_INTRO">Mmmnnnnnnngghhh... Don&#39;t take something if it isn&#39;t yours. That&#39;s the law.&lt;page&gt;Everything you see... it belongs to me.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t be angry. I&#39;ll share my food with you... if you give me Geo.</entry>
<entry name="MINER_MEET_REPEAT">Ohhh, bury the knight with her broken nail,&lt;br&gt;bury the... p-priest... something about a crown...?&lt;br&gt;I c-can&#39;t remember the rest of that one, ha ha ha! Maybe I&#39;ll just hum it.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_TRAMWAY_MEET">Oh! Ahh. Such a tiny creature, yet you dealt with all of those beasts?&lt;page&gt;I wasn&#39;t hiding, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re thinking. Just waiting for the right moment to pounce!...No... I can&#39;t speak such a lie... I was hiding.&lt;page&gt;Those ghastly things chased me and I ran. If you hadn&#39;t come along, who knows if I&#39;d ever have survived.&lt;page&gt;Others take me for a fearsome warrior, what with my impressive size, but this kingdom&#39;s beasts, I wonder if I&#39;m just no match for them?...&lt;page&gt;...</entry>
<entry name="KING_ABYSS_01">No cost too great.</entry>

<entry name="BRETTA_DIARY_1">                         The White Saviour&lt;br&gt;The maiden woke in darkness. Confused she reached out. Sharp brambles jabbed at all sides. Burning acid bubbled close below. What nightmare had led her here? What hope of survival remained?&lt;page&gt;Doomed she thought herself and to despair she fell, until a light bloomed far in the distance, a bright, glowing spot fast approaching. It swept majestic about the thorns, leapt above burning waters and dove towards the maiden.&lt;page&gt;Coming close, the form revealed at last, a beautiful being, sharp horns gleaming white. Arms reached out for the damsel, gathering her up, grip firm...</entry>
<entry name="KING_ABYSS_05">Born of God and Void.</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_DIARY_3">                         The White Saviour in Darkness&lt;br&gt;Troubled dreams beset the maiden. Her saviour gone, consumed below. Now her only companion the cold wind, moaning at her door. Her heart fluttered with sudden fear...&lt;page&gt;Then still. A sudden calm. Why? A presence. A figure close behind.&lt;page&gt;She doesn&#39;t dare look, doesn&#39;t dare move, fearful the slightest action would break the spell. She knew the presence at her bed, knew the calm only they could bring.&lt;page&gt;Her white saviour, now protector, standing tall beside, powerful, perfect...</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_DIARY_4">                         The Grey Prince&lt;br&gt;Heaving heavy breaths; flush from the exertion of battle; the figure emerged from the well. Triumph was his and trophy he bore to prove it, the fearsome skull of his vanquished opponent.&lt;page&gt;Startling warning he brought to the village, one that rung so true: Their white saviour, thought a hero by the bugs, was a vicious beast and this shrouded grey prince was in truth the hero deserved.&lt;page&gt;With honour and humility he recounted his quest below, his epic journey of one purpose, to find her, to protect her, his grey maiden, his partner in darkness...</entry>
<entry name="TUK_REPEAT">I&#39;ll share my food with you... if you give me Geo.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_DEEPNEST_REPEAT">I&#39;m taking what brief rest I can, then I&#39;m off in search of less terrifying challenge. This nest is no place to die.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_DREAM">...Does it know of the face that hides beneath? Such remarkable contrast the Wyrm conceived....</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_REPEAT_KINGSOUL">Ahh! So it bears our once-fractured soul, now complete. Such strength, such resolve, such dedication! Is it more than simply a Vessel? I almost feel like I&#39;m once again in the presence of my beloved Wyrm.&lt;page&gt;The Kingsoul... What is at the heart of it I wonder? If its curiosity wills it, it should seek out that place. That place where it was born, where it died, where it began...</entry>
<entry name="JINN_REOFFER">...Another? Does It offer gift to Jinn...?</entry>
<entry name="JINN_ACCEPT">...Gift is... horrible gift. Digusting...&lt;page&gt;But Jinn knows one who appreciates...Friend of Jinn. Eats nasties. Loves nasties. Shall accept. Shall provide.&lt;page&gt;Shinies for tiny It... Good to give Shinies. Less burden for Jinn.</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_DREAM_BENCH">My saviour, so close... </entry>
<entry name="KING_ABYSS_FINAL_A">You shall seal the blinding light that plagues their dreams.</entry>
<entry name="KING_ABYSS_FINAL_B">You are the Vessel.</entry>
<entry name="KING_ABYSS_FINAL_C">You are the Hollow Knight.</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_TALK_01">Within my roots, the weakening of the Vessel I plainly feel. Only two obvious outcomes there are from such a thing.&lt;page&gt;The first is inevitable on current course, regression, all minds relinquished to that pernicious plague.&lt;page&gt;The second I find preferable, and would seek your aid in its occurance, replacement.&lt;page&gt;I implore you, usurp the Vessel. Its supposed strength was ill-judged. It was tarnished by an idea instilled. But you. You are free of such blemishes. You could contain that thing inside.</entry>
<entry name="XUN_ACCEPT">Rare boon you grant Le&#39;mer. It will be che&#39;s last request. After this, never shall che&#39; lay burden on another.&lt;page&gt;A sacred flower is the offering. It is a rare, delicate object. One of a kind. You must cherish it, must act as though it were your own heart.&lt;page&gt;If you were to get hurt whilst carrying it, or did to attempt ride those jolting transit beasts, it would forever be destroyed.&lt;page&gt;Her grave lies in the middle of the Queen&#39;s overgrown estate. It is surrounded by her kind, who will not look kindly on your trespass.&lt;page&gt;Take care Le&#39;mer. My hopes I place upon you and my fervent wish that this small solace may come to pass.</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_DREAM_SHROOMISH">...Mishi umo sanga. Dogo!..</entry>
<entry name="TUK_EGGMAX">You have a lot of food, don&#39;t you? Mnngh... I can smell it on you.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re greedy... I won&#39;t share with you.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_COWARD">You placed your mark and left! What cowardice! Maybe you don&#39;t have what it takes?&lt;page&gt;A true warrior strides unstopping into battle. They gain strength by vanquishing others, not in flight from them.</entry>
<entry name="BIGCAT_REPEAT">Hmpph...Be on your way then? It&#39;s rest I&#39;ll return to, though in these times sleep oft proves uneasy. </entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_OPEN">Will you place your mark and attempt a trial?</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_1">...It&#39;s nice that you were able to help your friend. So you&#39;re not hungry any more?&lt;page&gt;Yes, that was quite the appetite. I was impressed. Still, we all move on sooner or later.&lt;page&gt;To greater things, perhaps? So much can be achieved in just a short time...</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_2">...Shouldn&#39;t trust the eye they gave you. Rely on your own instincts.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;ve got a keen nose, use it.&lt;page&gt;And while you&#39;re hunting for secrets, beware those who are hunting you!</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_3">...The dead can&#39;t make use of wealth in any case. What would they spend it on?&lt;page&gt;Yes, a big brood like that. They need food. And shelter. And toys.&lt;page&gt;If you keep some for yourself... Well, I think you deserve it. Yes...</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_4">...What was called a &quot;hero&quot; in its moment may be called something very different after time has passed. &lt;page&gt;The crimes and triumphs of our predecessors echo all around us, don&#39;t they?&lt;page&gt;The chains of fate that bind us all together... do you really want to break them?</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_5">...Well if things are getting too dangerous down there, maybe it&#39;s time to take a break?&lt;page&gt;Come back up and spend some time hunting, or gathering, or wandering aimlessly.&lt;page&gt;No, not too much longer now...</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_6">...I haven&#39;t seen her, no. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll remember where you left her eventually.&lt;page&gt;Trust the moon, or yourself. Or trust her. You need to trust something, that&#39;s my point.&lt;page&gt;Hmm? No, not him. No. Absolutely not.</entry>
<entry name="MR_MUSHROOM_7">...It&#39;s not by tools that you&#39;ll triumph, it&#39;s through your smarts, your speed, your determination....</entry>
<entry name="MINER_EARLY_2_B">Ha ha ha! Are you suh... surprised? I remembered the second verse! Lots of time to think while I work down here. Maybe I can even c-come up with some songs of my own!</entry>
<entry name="MINER_INFECTED_REPEAT">...Bury... body... cover... shell,&lt;br&gt;Darkness. No meaning... DANGEROUS... Still, remain...&lt;br&gt;LIGHT.... again...</entry>
<entry name="TISO_DREAM_LAKE">That place calls to me. Somewhere beyond this lake, perhaps?</entry>
<entry name="BRETTA_RESCUE_2">Oh?! Who are you?&lt;page&gt;Your face... you&#39;re so... so...</entry>
<entry name="DUNG_DEFENDER_ISMA">Ahh! That tear... You&#39;ve been to her grove!&lt;page&gt;I swore I&#39;d visit, but... my duties... my oath...&lt;page&gt;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Ignore me, I&#39;m being foolish. If I&#39;m not careful I&#39;ll sink down into old memories and won&#39;t ever come back again.&lt;page&gt;She&#39;s a great judge of character, so if she gave you her blessing you must be something special indeed. I&#39;m barely worthy to be in your presence!</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_GREET">Enough talking! Your jabbering... annoying. Step over here and show me your Geo.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_QG_REPEAT">Stay alive my friend. Whatever you seek in here, I&#39;m sure that tribe won&#39;t look lightly on our intrusion.</entry>
<entry name="EMILITIA_GREET">In times past I wouldn&#39;t have spoken with your likes, but now the rest of my caste are wonderfully, distantly deceased.&lt;page&gt;If I didn&#39;t welcome you I&#39;d never have anyone to share my happiness with.</entry>
<entry name="CLOTH_FUNG_GREET">I wasn&#39;t hiding, you know. Just napping before I head off again.&lt;page&gt;Bound to be facing even more deadly beasts soon, so I gotta keep me strength up.</entry>

<entry name="SPIDER_DREAM">Gah!! Get out! Get out! Get out!</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_NOTENOUGHGEO">A pauper... not enough Geo.&lt;page&gt;Leave now. Return with more Geo.</entry>
<entry name="MINER_MEET_1_B">Ha ha ha, do you know that one? It&#39;s one of my f-favourites! We can sing something else if you like. You start singing and I&#39;ll join in. I bet you have a b-b-beautiful singing voice! Ha ha ha!&lt;page&gt;So, what are you down here for? If you came to g-get wealthy, just look around you! These mines are still bursting with riches! There&#39;s p-p-plenty for everyone, just grab a pick and join in! Ha ha!</entry>
<entry name="QUEEN_TALK_02">I&#39;ll offer fair warning. The Vessel may itself be weak, but it is much empowered by that force within.&lt;page&gt;To claim its role requires strength of some magnitude. Prepare yourself well before attempting the task.</entry>
<entry name="LEGEATER_REMEET">You&#39;ve changed your mind, haven&#39;t you? Give me Geo, and you can see something... nice.</entry>
<entry name="LITTLE_FOOL_UNPAID">Stop there! That trial is closed to those who haven&#39;t made the proper contribution. Step over here, quickly, and bring your Geo with you!</entry>
<entry name="BLANK_TEST"></entry>
<entry name="SPIDER_REPEAT">My dear. Aren&#39;t you so kind, checking again on my well-being. I&#39;m ever the caring host. I can&#39;t understand why more don&#39;t visit in your manner.&lt;page&gt;Now you won&#39;t mind while I take just a little bite... Just a leg perhaps? A full belly is the best path to happiness...</entry>
<entry name="TUK_DREAM">Mmmnnnnnnngghhh... I&#39;ll find you again. The water will bring you to me. I just need to keep searching... and praying.&lt;page&gt;When we meet again... I want you to say... that you&#39;re sorry.</entry>
