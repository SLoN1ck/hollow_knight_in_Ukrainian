<entry name="MATO_GREET">My pupil, you have come to visit your old master! This is an honour I scarcely deserve.&lt;page&gt;Please, sit. You are always welcome to meditate here with me.</entry>
<entry name="MATO_ORO">That Nail Art, the Dash Slash... learnt from my brother Oro, was it not?&lt;page&gt;So he is still alive then. Hm. I still haven&#39;t forgotten what he owes me and I never will.&lt;page&gt;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t bother you with such things. I&#39;m happy that you were able to train under another Nailmaster and grow stronger, my pupil.</entry>
<entry name="ORO_GREET">You&#39;ve returned, though you were not invited. &lt;page&gt;As my pupil, it is lawful that I allow you rest and shelter, but do not stay longer than you need to.</entry>
<entry name="ORO_MATO">That Nail Art... you have been training with my brother Mato.&lt;page&gt;He has strange notions of loyalty and honour. I&#39;m sure he was difficult and unpleasant to train under.&lt;page&gt;Did he mention my name to you? If he does, tell him to be patient. He&#39;ll be waiting a while longer before I give him what he wants.</entry>
<entry name="ORO_BOW">I have taught you all I can. Go back into the world, traveller. Leave me to my solitude.</entry>
<entry name="ORO_ART">So what will it be, traveller? Will you pay the price asked of you, or will you leave this place unenlightened?</entry>
<entry name="ORO_SLY">That charm you bear... It seems the Great Nailsage has deemed you skilled enough in the Nail Arts to earn his highest esteem.&lt;page&gt;I do not begrudge you his love. You have earned it.&lt;page&gt;And perhaps by helping you along your path, I have redeemed myself... if only a little.</entry>
<entry name="MATO_SHEO">Ah! So my brother Sheo has taught you his Nail Art, the Great Slash! How lucky you are to have trained with him!&lt;page&gt;Sheo and I were very close when we trained together under the Great Nailsage. He often spoke of becoming tired of the Nail Arts and wanting to try something new.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m glad to see he changed his mind and continues to bear the proud title of Nailmaster along with me!</entry>
<entry name="MATO_REPEAT">Before you leave, rest and meditate with me for a while. Your company is always welcome.</entry>
<entry name="MATO_TAUGHT">Your form... exquisite! Now I know how my own master felt when he passed down his teachings to us.&lt;page&gt;I hope you don&#39;t think me too forward when I say that I consider you to be my child. Yes! When I saw you perform my Nail Art I felt a bond between us suddenly flash into existence!&lt;page&gt;You honour me beyond words, my pupil...&lt;page&gt;Thank you.</entry>
<entry name="MATO_REFUSE">My pupil, why do you hesitate? Do you think yourself unworthy of my Nail Art?&lt;page&gt;Do not fret. I too was once like you, unsure of my own strength. Stay here with me and meditate, and once you are ready we can begin the lesson.</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_MATO">That Nail Art you&#39;ve learnt, the Cyclone Slash. That was always Mato&#39;s favourite.&lt;page&gt;It must have made him ecstatic to have a pupil like you. He always wanted to pass down what he&#39;d learnt to a new generation.&lt;page&gt;He was not the most skilled pupil himself, but his enthusiasm and his kindness set him apart. I&#39;m glad he achieved what he desired for so long. To be a teacher...</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_MEET">A visitor! Why have you crept in here, little grub? Perhaps, like me, you have a taste for discovering new things?&lt;page&gt;I am Sheo, and in a previous life I was a Nailmaster. Yes, the only thing that drove me was becoming stronger and honing my skills with a nail.&lt;page&gt;I imagined it was my one calling in life, but that feeling faded over time. Now I seek a new calling, something that speaks to my soul and compels me forward.&lt;page&gt;That&#39;s why I spend my time here, secluded, trying to master the art of creation. Painting, sculpting... these things bring a different kind of pleasure.&lt;page&gt;Mmm. You don&#39;t seem very moved by what I&#39;ve said. Was it Sheo the Nailmaster you were looking for? Did you come to learn a Nail Art? I&#39;ll teach you if you insist...</entry>
<entry name="ORO_MEET">Hmph. How did you find me, down here where the world ends?&lt;page&gt;Yes, I know why you&#39;re here. You came to learn a Nail Art from the legendary Nailmaster Oro.&lt;page&gt;It is the law of the Great Nailsage that I must pass down my teachings to those who are worthy.&lt;page&gt;But no law forbids me from exacting a payment for my time. If you truly wish to train under me, prove it with Geo!</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_ART">Something about your bearing... I feel as though you haven&#39;t yet abandoned the way of the nail. I can teach you something, if you like... </entry>
<entry name="SHEO_SLY">That charm! Only the Great Nailsage could have given that to you...&lt;page&gt;Seeing how strong you&#39;ve become... it almost makes me want to take up my nail once more.&lt;page&gt;But no, I should stay on my current path and keep working at my art. If the Great Nailsage ever comes by, I want to show him how far I&#39;ve come.</entry>
<entry name="MATO_BOW">You honour me beyond words, my pupil...&lt;page&gt;Thank you.</entry>
<entry name="MATO_ART">Ah, I can see it in your eyes - you&#39;re ready to learn my Nail Art! Shall we begin the lesson immediately?</entry>
<entry name="ORO_REFUSE">&quot;Those who do not share their strength will never learn.&quot; My master used to say that.&lt;page&gt;Substitute &quot;Geo&quot; for &quot;strength&quot; and you&#39;ll have my own views on the matter. Begone!</entry>
<entry name="MATO_SLY">That charm...! Could it be?! Only the Great Nailsage himself could have bestowed such a thing!&lt;page&gt;Your achievements humble my own, my pupil. I myself have sworn never to lay eyes on the Nailsage again. Not until I have truly mastered his teachings.&lt;page&gt;But if you see him again, please... let him know that I am forever grateful.</entry>
<entry name="ORO_REPEAT">Rest here if you must, but do not stay longer than you need to.</entry>
<entry name="ORO_TAUGHT">Hmph. I must say, you are an excellent pupil.&lt;page&gt;Your skill with the nail, and your thirst to become stronger... you remind me of my brothers.&lt;page&gt;I have taught you all I can. Go back into the world, traveller, and leave me to my solitude.</entry>
<entry name="ORO_SHEO">I see you&#39;ve been taught a Nail Art by my brother Sheo. How fortunate of you.&lt;page&gt;Yes, he was the mightiest of the Great Nailsage&#39;s pupils, far outshining Mato and myself. My brother and my master loved him very much.&lt;page&gt;He was always aloof, but... not unkind. When we last spoke, he said he was going to teach himself something completely new. I wonder if he achieved that goal.</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_REFUSE">Oh? Have you, too, grown weary of the weight of a nail? I understand. Stay, if you like, and we can make art together.</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_NAILSMITH">Oh, look who&#39;s joined us! We have quite a merry crowd now, don&#39;t we?&lt;page&gt;This fellow came wandering in to my hut, quite distraught and on his own quest for a new calling in life.&lt;page&gt;We talked, and found a common love of creating and building and honing a craft. So now we make art together!&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s good to have company, I hadn&#39;t realised how lonely I was. It&#39;s like being with my brothers again! Stay with us, if you like!</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_REPEAT">I have spare brushes and plenty of paint. Once you tire of the nail, feel free to join me in my art.</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_DREAM">My brother, Oro... what drove you to hide away deep down at the very edge of that ash swept grave?&lt;page&gt;Was it pride, or fear, or shame? Perhaps you should lay down your nail if it haunts you so, and find a new calling that eases your soul.</entry>
<entry name="MATO_DREAM">My brother, Sheo... how fare you in that green kingdom of thorns you call home? I think of you every time I raise my nail...&lt;page&gt;Do you ever close your eyes and remember the time we spent together with Oro and our master? I like to think you do...</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_TAUGHT">So! My work, does it move you?&lt;page&gt;The wielding of a nail, the wielding of a brush... these things are not so different.&lt;page&gt;We cut into the world so that we can peer deeper inside.&lt;page&gt;For now though, I have nothing more to teach you. Your path forwards... only you can see it. Good luck.</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_ORO">So you met my brother Oro and convinced him to teach you his Nail Art. Hmm.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen him. I wonder how much he&#39;s changed. He always seemed to be haunted by something, though I never learned what.&lt;page&gt;No matter the distance between us though, we are still brothers. I hope that passing down his learnings to you brought him some happiness.</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_REPEAT_MODEL">Building these models takes patience and a light touch. It&#39;s worth it though, seeing the grand old Knights of Hallownest come to life before our eyes.&lt;page&gt;Mighty Hegemol was always my favourite. What a towering figure he was, though surprisingly soft spoken for one so large.&lt;page&gt;They were all impressive in their own right, of course. Fierce Dryya, kindly Isma, mysterious Ze&#39;mer... erm, and the other one.</entry>
<entry name="ORO_DREAM">Brother Mato, in your lonely home at the top of the world... do you still think of me as an enemy?&lt;page&gt;In the future, if you will listen... I will tell you why I chose to tread this path.</entry>
<entry name="MATO_MEET">Hm? Ah, well met! Yes, I thought I could sense the aura of a fierce warrior approaching.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m impressed you found my sanctuary here at the top of the world. No doubt you&#39;ve endured many trials and overcome many foes in your quest to find me.&lt;page&gt;No, don&#39;t speak a word. I, Nailmaster Mato, who was taught the Art of the Nail by the Great Nailsage himself, hereby accept you as my pupil! Let us begin the lesson immediately!</entry>
<entry name="SHEO_GREET">So, your travels have brought you back. What have you learnt? How have you grown?&lt;page&gt;Myself? I am still trying to capture something with my brush... although I&#39;m not quite sure what that thing is.</entry>
