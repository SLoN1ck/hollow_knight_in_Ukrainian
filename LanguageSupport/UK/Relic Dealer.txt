<entry name="RELICDEALER_DOOR">Gone out to clear my head. Will be back soon. If you have something you absolutely must sell, come find me in Fountain Square.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_1">A Wanderer&#39;s Journal, eh?&lt;page&gt;Though they&#39;re common finds about the kingdom, I much enjoy the deciphering of their text.&lt;page&gt;Read together they paint a morbid tale. It seems fate was unkind to most who travel within Hallownest&#39;s ruin.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_2">Another Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;I might not offer a lot for each but they&#39;re plentiful about the caverns and I doubt you&#39;ll find another willing to make trade for Geo.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_3">A Wanderer&#39;s Journal? Yes. Yes. I&#39;ll add it to the pile with the others.&lt;page&gt;I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll get to decipher this one. It&#39;s long hard work translating the many languages of the bugs that explore these caverns.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_4">A Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;You&#39;ve a knack for finding these. Corpses must be frequent on your journey. No doubt your nail&#39;s created many more.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_5">Another Wanderer&#39;s Journal, eh?&lt;page&gt;This journal is of traditional stone type. Text endures well upon it.&lt;page&gt;In its declining age, this city switched from stone to parchment woven of spider&#39;s silk.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a small tragedy, but the moisture in these towers has rendered most of those texts illegible. </entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_6">A Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;Have you heard that saying about stone journals?&lt;page&gt;If danger lurks close by and your nail has dulled with wear,&lt;br&gt;Just swing your journal at your foes with blunt and deadly flair.&lt;page&gt;S&#39;a good one isn&#39;t it! And accurate. They sure have a heft to them.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_7">What&#39;s that? A Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve so many of these now. Once I get around to deciphering them all, I&#39;ll be the preeminent scholar on Hallownest&#39;s dead.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_CONVO_1">No touching the antiques! My stock is not for sale.&lt;page&gt;Still, if you&#39;ve managed to come upon any interesting trinkets during your travels, I may be willing to trade. Step over to the counter here and I&#39;ll see what you&#39;ve got.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_SEAL_4">Another Hallownest Seal?&lt;page&gt;Others have told me there&#39;s a statue out by the city&#39;s entrance depicting a large knightly figure. Could be one of the Kingdom&#39;s great five.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;d have looked it over myself, but the gate&#39;s long been shut tight and it&#39;s too much hassle taking the long way round with all those blasted husks about.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_SEAL_5">Yep, that&#39;s another Hallownest Seal alright.&lt;page&gt;The shop&#39;ll be overflowing with these things soon. Gah! I&#39;d never guessed so many would still be lying around.&lt;page&gt;If they&#39;re as common as you make them seem, maybe I&#39;ve been offering too much for them?</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_SEAL_6">Another Hallownest Seal? Pass it over then.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_SEAL_7">A Hallownest Seal?&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re a talented collector, alright. The best I&#39;ve met. If you keep at it, I worry I&#39;ll run out of space in the shop!</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_DREAM_FOUNTAIN">...Who were you mystery knight?... Why no mention beyond your fountain?..</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_IDOL_1">A King&#39;s Idol, eh?&lt;page&gt;Hallownest&#39;s king was an elusive figure, deified by the citizens. With the king rarely seen, worship was offered through these idols.&lt;page&gt;There&#39;s an expert craft to them. Few alive could match this skill.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_IDOL_2">A King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;If you look closely, each of these idols is subtly different. There are fine engravings about them that take some time to decipher.&lt;page&gt;I suspect each was tailored to the owner. A personalised symbol of the king&#39;s omnipotence.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_IDOL_3">Another King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;Have you visited the remnants of his palace? It&#39;s down below this city, in the bedrock of the kingdom.&lt;page&gt;Must&#39;ve been an impressive sight in its time. Now there&#39;s nothing left.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a strange thing though. There are no signs of conflict around the area. It&#39;s as though the whole place just vanished. </entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_IDOL_4">A King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve often wondered the true visage of the king. Depictions are of an imposing, gleaming figure and a fiercely horned crown.&lt;page&gt;I suspect there&#39;s much embellishment in the imagery though. A ruler seeking worship tends to hide their blemishes. It&#39;d do no good to appear a common bug.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_IDOL_5">A King&#39;s Idol?&lt;page&gt;With as many of these as you&#39;ve delivered, the other Relic Seekers are like to think I&#39;ve gone mad for the King!&lt;page&gt;Pah! Who am I kidding. They&#39;ll only be jealous of my collection. Find me more!</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_NO_RELICS_2">Not carrying any relics with you? Go find some for me. I&#39;ll pay good Geo for nice items.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN_REPEAT">I&#39;ll be getting back to the shop soon. If I stay out here too long I&#39;ll get washed into the Waterways.&lt;page&gt;Come and visit if you like. If you have relics, I mean. I&#39;m not much for chatter.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_SHOP_INTRO">Aye Aye. Come searching for rare items have you? Well hands off! This collection is mine and I won&#39;t be selling to grubby little wanderers.&lt;page&gt;Still, I imagine you come across many interesting items in your travels. Maybe you&#39;d care to part with some? I&#39;ll offer a fair trade for each.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_SEAL_1">A Hallownest Seal, eh? Very interesting this.&lt;page&gt;Do you know of the Kingdom&#39;s five great knights? They&#39;re revered figures of Hallownest, often mentioned in the annals of the Kingdom, but only as a group.&lt;page&gt;Both their names and appearance seem to have been expunged from history.&lt;page&gt;So long has passed since their time. It&#39;d be a grand achievement to discover their identities.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_SEAL_2">Another Hallownest Seal? Pass it over.&lt;page&gt;Ah. I enjoy collecting their like, but there&#39;s little information to be gleaned of each.&lt;page&gt;Mind you, they do keep a nice shine about them and there&#39;s nothing wrong with appreciating something purely on aesthetic merits.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_NO_RELICS">Hm. Looks like you don&#39;t have any relics on you. If you manage to find any in good condition, bring them to me and I&#39;ll give you a fair amount of Geo for them.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_DREAM">...This short one&#39;s got an odd look about it... though vaguely familiar?..</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_DUNG">Urgh! What do you think you&#39;re doing, coming into my nice little shop stinking like that?!&lt;page&gt;These relics have been through enough. They don&#39;t need you spreading your stench all over them! Crawl back to the Waterways or wherever you came from!</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_TALK_REPEAT">We&#39;ve talked enough I think. Relics need cleaning. Texts need deciphering. Out with you! This isn&#39;t a museum.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_JOURNAL_8">A Wanderer&#39;s Journal?&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s quite incredible how many of these you&#39;ve collected. You must have travelled the breadth of the kingdom to accrue such a haul.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_EGG_1">An Arcane Egg, eh? Now this, this is an ancient thing. These relics are the prize of my profession. There&#39;s knowledge hidden within, though it&#39;s very difficult, painstaking work to extract.&lt;page&gt;One large understanding can be gleaned though. This civilisation may claim itself the first, but something else did exist within this place before Hallownest.&lt;page&gt;Each egg offers a narrow glimpse into that forgotten age.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_EGG_2">Another Arcane Egg?&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a rare chance to own two of these. I&#39;ll be the envy of all my colleagues, though my purse is feeling much lighter for it.&lt;page&gt;These eggs are the most desired find from time before Hallownest, but they&#39;re not the only remnant of that age.&lt;page&gt;You may have come upon them, those old statues that seem a store for soul? They too prove its existence, though in a larger, cruder form. </entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_EGG_3">A third Arcane Egg? You&#39;re an exceptional explorer to have found so many.&lt;page&gt;An egg is a perfect protective form. In Hallownest we use stone journals or tablets, our text engraved atop. These eggs are far more secure. Their records are stored within.&lt;page&gt;In fear of damaging the eggs, I&#39;m only able to access the outer layer, but it&#39;s clear those in the distant past could somehow access information stored even deeper within.&lt;page&gt;If only I could find a way to do so. Just think of the discoveries to be made!</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_EGG_4">A fourth Arcane Egg! I wouldn&#39;t have believed it possible. I&#39;ve never met a bug with your knack for uncovering this Kingdom&#39;s treasures.&lt;page&gt;You must have some sort of sense about you? Or maybe these eggs are somehow drawn to you.&lt;page&gt;My fellows have claimed there&#39;s a will of sorts within each egg, that each seeks its own bearer, or reject them.&lt;page&gt;That&#39;d be a subtle power indeed, and I remain sceptical. Relic Seekers are prone to confusing facts with fable.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_TALK">There&#39;s a forgotten history hidden in this kingdom&#39;s antiques, though few seem willing to look. Others come just to claw away at the cracks and ruins.&lt;page&gt;Pah! Scavengers and thieves. It&#39;s contemptible.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_SEAL_3">A Hallownest Seal, eh? Give it here.&lt;page&gt;Do you have anything else for me? If not, get your damp little self out of my home.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_TALK_2">Admiring my shop are you? Well I&#39;m no squatter.&lt;page&gt;This place was dead empty when I moved in and there&#39;s no one left alive who&#39;d lay claim to the tower.&lt;page&gt;If you fancy yourself a domicile in the city, go find somewhere else, preferably in another building.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m well content with just my relics. I&#39;m not after neighbours.</entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_NAILSMITH">That nail you bear looks mighty blunt. There&#39;re cracks all through it. It&#39;s as much a relic as the objects in my shop!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve little interest in weapons myself, but it may be an idea to hunt down that old Nailsmith.&lt;page&gt;His hut&#39;s on the outskirts of the city. Not that far from here. He might help add some sting to your weapon, provided he&#39;s feeling generous.  </entry>
<entry name="RELICDEALER_FOUNTAIN">Oh? What are you doing out in this miserable downpour?&lt;page&gt;Impressive fountain isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m sure we&#39;d be able to appreciate it more if we weren&#39;t both getting drenched.&lt;page&gt;That knight up there was an important one. The plaque here mentions its &#39;sacrifice,&#39; which carries something of an ominous tone.&lt;page&gt;Probably met some sort of horrible end, though it sounds like the knight&#39;s goal may have been achieved in the process&lt;page&gt;In all the relics I&#39;ve collected, I&#39;ve yet to find a clue as to what that was.</entry>
