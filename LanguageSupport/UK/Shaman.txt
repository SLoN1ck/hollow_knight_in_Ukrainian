<entry name="SHAMAN_MEET">Oho! Who is that creeping out of the darkness? My, you&#39;re looking grim! A strange, empty face and a wicked looking weapon!&lt;page&gt;Something important has drawn you down into Hallownest&#39;s corpse, but I won&#39;t ask what. Perhaps the reason you&#39;ve found me is because you need my help?&lt;page&gt;Say no more, friend. I&#39;m going to give you a gift, a nasty little spell of my own creation. It&#39;s just perfect for a little one like you! Ohoho!</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_OPENED_GATE">Why do you hesitate? You&#39;ll get nothing more from me, I&#39;m afraid.&lt;page&gt;Though I do admire your persistence! Ohohohoho! </entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_SCREAM">Pried a spell out&#39;ve my larger cousin did you? Aren&#39;t you the charming one.&lt;page&gt;She&#39;s not usually the generous sort, certainly not as giving as myself, but she does have that wonderful voice! It&#39;s no surprise her spells take on such aural force. </entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_FUNG_DREAM">...Hear...me...</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_TRAPPED_1">Oho? You&#39;ve woken at last! I apologise, perhaps I should have warned you about the power of that spell. I was watching over you as you slept, but seem to have slipped away myself! Ohohoho!&lt;page&gt;Now we&#39;re awake, I was wondering whether you would do me a small favour. Not as repayment for my gift of course, simply because we&#39;re now friends.&lt;page&gt;You see, a horrid great beast has made its home in the heart of this temple. Such disrespect! I would be quite grateful if you were to venture deeper in and slay it for me.&lt;page&gt;It&#39;s a hardy creature, but with your new power you&#39;re more than a match for it! Good luck with this small favour, my friend! Ohohohohohoho!</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_OPEN_GATE">And look! The gate between us has opened. Ohoho!&lt;page&gt;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re eager to move on. Farewell, and have faith! Whatever you are seeking... it will find you! Ohohoho!</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_DREAM">Poking around in the dreams of others... You&#39;re more curious than you look! Oho ho ho ho!</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_SUMMONED_2">Oho, you&#39;ve come back! Didn&#39;t you like the look of my gift? You left without saying a word!&lt;page&gt;Perhaps you&#39;re braver than you think! Go ahead and take what belongs to you!</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_CRYSTAL_DREAM">...Free...me...</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_QUAKE">Ah ho! I&#39;m sensing new power about you, one that&#39;ll crack the rock beneath us. A useful thing for one looking to travel ever deeper.&lt;page&gt;My third uncle used to possess similar abilities. He also possessed a ferocious temper! Ohohoho! What a dreadful combination. </entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_RETURN">Oho! What brings you back through here, little shadow? Are you lost?&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t worry about me. I don&#39;t need anything more from you. Ohohoho!</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_KILLED_BLOCKER_1">Oho! So it&#39;s done then, you&#39;ve slain the beast!&lt;page&gt;The poor thing! It must have been terrified of you. It used to be quite docile, but the rancid air in these caverns filled it with some ancient rage.&lt;page&gt;Still, you did what had to be done! You have my gratitude! Of course, we both know you wouldn&#39;t have made it through without that spell of mine... Ohoho!</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_KILLED_BLOCKER_2">Oho! There you are! I was watching over you while you slept, and must have slipped away myself. I woke up and found you&#39;d disappeared! You are a surprising one, ohoho!&lt;page&gt;Actually, I wanted to ask a small favour of you. You see, there is a certain creature lurking just above us, in the heart of this temple...&lt;page&gt;...Oho? Well, yet another surprise! You&#39;ve slain that creature before I&#39;ve even asked!&lt;page&gt;I scarcely deserve such a friend as you! You&#39;re a marvel! Ohohoho!</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_FUNG">A corpse overgrown with vegetation.</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_QUAKE2">My friend. My friend. There&#39;s another quality about you yet. You didn&#39;t perchance visit my fourth aunt?&lt;page&gt;She makes her home beside that Crystal Mount. Leaves quite an impression on those that seek her out. Were I not bound here, I&#39;d love to visit myself.</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_FIREBALL2">What&#39;s this? My vengeful gift has warped within you. You&#39;ve twisted it into something... else.&lt;page&gt;Ohohohoh! I knew it. My friend! You&#39;re a marvel. Your essence has melded with the spell.&lt;page&gt;You must have found a powerful source to transform it in such a unique, expressive way.</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_SUMMONED_1">Don&#39;t be afraid. Have faith! That spell belongs to you now, all you need to do is take it!&lt;page&gt;Ohohoho, you won&#39;t be going much further without it, I promise you!</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_SCREAM2">That scream? Ooohh, distorted in such a way... It&#39;s not within the skills of us snails to do such a thing.&lt;page&gt;Wherever you draw this new power from, it&#39;s not a place my kind ever thought to look.</entry>
<entry name="SHAMAN_TRAPPED_2">What is it? Are you wondering about this gate between us? Ohoho! It&#39;s a curious thing, but this door will not open until you have slain that creature lying in the heart of the temple.&lt;page&gt;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m sure the spirits of my ancestors will be watching over you.</entry>
