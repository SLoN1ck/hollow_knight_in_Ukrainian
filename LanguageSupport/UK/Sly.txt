<entry name="SLY_RESCUE_2">Oh! What?! Who are you?!&lt;page&gt;...I see. This old village. What a strange dream, to have led me down here! If you hadn&#39;t found me, I don&#39;t think I would&#39;ve ever woken.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_RESCUE_3">I&#39;m Sly. Usually, I live an uneventful life up in Dirtmouth. The air in these ruins doesn&#39;t agree with me, so I&#39;d best be getting back.&lt;page&gt;If you return above, come and see me. I&#39;m probably the friendliest face left there, and I can thank you properly for your good deed.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_SHOP_INTRO">Ah, hello! I knew we&#39;d meet again. How do you like my cosy little store? I&#39;ve made myself pretty comfortable here, selling old trinkets to travellers like yourself.&lt;page&gt;If you&#39;re planning a trip below, I&#39;ve several items that may improve your chance of survival.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_BASEMENT_1">...So, another would join our group.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_BASEMENT_2">I have a gift for you, warrior. As a shopkeeper, I admit parting with it for free is rather difficult.&lt;page&gt;But as the Great Nailsage I must recognise your skill. You have mastered the arts of my remaining pupils. Now tradition decrees you too may hold the symbol.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_BASEMENT_3">Wear it proudly, Nailmaster. You shall be the last to receive its like.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_GENERIC">Pockets feeling empty? If you need some more Geo, take a trip into the ruins below us and hunt around. Just take care not to fall into a haze. I won&#39;t be coming down to rescue you.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_KEY_2">What do you have there? Why, that&#39;s the key to my storeroom! I thought I&#39;d lost it for good.&lt;page&gt;Hmm? Did you find it in those old mines perhaps? Very curious. I&#39;ve no idea how it ended up in such a remote place.&lt;page&gt;Very honest of you to return it to me, yes. Very kind. And now that I can open my old storeroom up, I can sell you some of the rare stock that&#39;s been gathering dust in there.&lt;page&gt;These items may be a little time-worn, but they still retain their full market value. Very precious stuff! Take a look... </entry>
<entry name="SLY_RESCUE_1">...ugghh, Oro you oaf.... You wield your nail... like a club...&lt;page&gt;...Esmy... how much deeper do we have to go...</entry>
<entry name="SLY_GENERIC_NM">How are your travels, Nailmaster? As time goes by, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll only grow stronger.&lt;page&gt;If you see your fellow Nailmasters again, tell them I carry them in my thoughts always. And that they should come and buy something from their old teacher as a mark of respect.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_NAILART">Hmm, you seem a little different. Something has changed in your bearing.&lt;page&gt;Ah! The way you hold your nail! So you&#39;ve learnt a Nail Art...&lt;page&gt;Very interesting. I wonder, do you have the passion to continue your training?</entry>
<entry name="SLY_DREAM_STORE">...Wherever you are... Whatever it is you do now... I hope you three are looking after yourselves...</entry>
<entry name="SLY_NOSTOCK_2">Back again? You know I haven&#39;t any stock left, yes? You&#39;ve cleaned me out.&lt;page&gt;Or were you hoping to sneak a peek at my mountain of Geo? Well it&#39;s mine now! And fairly traded. </entry>
<entry name="SLY_KEY">What do you have there? Why, that&#39;s the key to my storeroom! I thought I&#39;d lost it for good.&lt;page&gt;Hmm? Did you find it in those old mines perhaps? Very curious. I&#39;ve no idea how it ended up in such a remote place.&lt;page&gt;Very honest of you to return it to me, yes. Very kind. And now that I can open my old storeroom up, I can sell you some of the rare stock that&#39;s been gathering dust in there.&lt;page&gt;These items may be a little time-worn, but they still retain their full market value. Very precious stuff! Take a look... </entry>
<entry name="SLY_MAPPER">I see they&#39;ve opened that mapping shop across the way. I suppose a little competition is healthy.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps I should start to sell maps as well... or is that a little aggressive? Heh. All&#39;s fair in a world made of Geo.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_NAIL_HONED">You&#39;ve found a new nail, then? It looks like a much finer weapon than the last.&lt;page&gt;Hmm? Oh, this is the same nail... but it&#39;s been honed! By someone extremely skilled...&lt;page&gt;A nail is an extension of ourselves, it is the instrument by which we shape the world around us. It&#39;s a sacred duty to keep its edges sharp.&lt;page&gt;...Heh, sorry. I shouldn&#39;t ramble on like that. Let&#39;s talk Geo instead.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_BASEMENT_REPEAT">Off you go Nailmaster. I&#39;ve nothing more to give you...&lt;page&gt;Nothing for free at least. I&#39;ll be up briefly and eager take your Geo in trade for my precious wares.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_DREAM_BASEMENT">...These refined weapons...The battles of Geo are much deadlier...</entry>
<entry name="SLY_RESCUE_REPEAT">You&#39;re exploring then? Very brave! Plenty of courageous wanderers have been lost to the hunger of these old caverns.&lt;page&gt;You have your nail though, and I can tell just by looking that you know how to wield it.</entry>
<entry name="SLY_DREAM_RUINS">...Geo. Geo. All the world is Geo. No nail can withstand its might...</entry>
<entry name="SLY_NOSTOCK_1">Ah, still looking for something to buy? Is your Geo weighing you down? Unfortunately, you seem to have cleared out everything I&#39;d be willing to part with. Nothing left at all!&lt;page&gt;I think there might be a few old trinkets down in my storeroom, but I lost the key a while ago.&lt;page&gt;So, no more business between us I&#39;m afraid! For now at least. Get out of here and let me spend some quality time with all the Geo you&#39;ve gifted me.</entry>
