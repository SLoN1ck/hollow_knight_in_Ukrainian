<entry name="STAG_TOWN">This place... we are near the surface, I believe? There is a town here. You should take the opportunity to rest.&lt;page&gt;This place was once full of travellers coming and going. It seems much quieter now.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_GREENPATH">My, this place is much changed since I last saw it. The greenery grows so wild the station&#39;s like to be consumed by it.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_HOPE_2">Yes, I will hold onto that hope. My kin, still alive, still out there, journeying beyond these lands.&lt;page&gt;But for me, I could never abandon the stagways. Not as long as passengers still need them.&lt;page&gt;I can tell you still have important work to do. I will be your companion as long as my old body still serves.&lt;page&gt;Let us enjoy the old stagways of this kingdom together a little longer.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_END_SPEAK">Eager to travel the stagways? Just hop upon that platform, give me the signal and we&#39;ll soon be on our way.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_NEST">Being back in my old home... I feel the weight of my long life bearing down on me.&lt;page&gt;I carry it proudly, though. Wherever I travel, the memories of my family and my kind come with me.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_ROYALGARDENS">Before you rang the bell, I&#39;d almost forgotten this station existed. It was not often used by the common bugs, being a well-guarded retreat for our late Queen.&lt;page&gt;Even as overgrown as they&#39;ve become, these gardens are still beautiful after all this time. I&#39;m sure the Queen would be happy to know that.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_RUINS2">Little one, we stand in the King&#39;s Station! Named of course for the King of Hallownest, he who ordered the building of the stagways and stations.&lt;page&gt;The King never rode the stagways himself, but I&#39;ve heard he was a glorious bug to behold, bright and radiant in visage, so much so it hurt to look at him.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_MEET">Greetings, little one! It&#39;s been an age since I last heard the ringing of a station bell. It echoed down the stagways and called me to you.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve grown stiff and tired over these many years and I&#39;ve forgotten much, but the sound of the bell will always call me back.&lt;page&gt;These stagways stretch the depths of Hallownest. If you want to travel them, hail me from the platform. I will take you where you need to go.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_DEEPNEST">Ahh, little one... Where are we? I have never been to this station. It has a strange air of danger to it. Let me take you somewhere safer, quickly.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_TRAVEL_1">Ready to go, little one?</entry>
<entry name="STAG_RESTINGGROUNDS">The Resting Grounds... Passengers would come here to conduct rituals for those who had passed on.&lt;page&gt;Not any more though. Perhaps the dead conduct their own rituals now?</entry>
<entry name="STAG_TRAM">That pass you hold! Is it not for that ghastly machine, the tram? I hope you&#39;re not thinking of riding on that grotesque contraption.&lt;page&gt;The thought a mere machine could attempt what we stags do! Foolish...Very foolish.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_CROSSROADS">It was a long time ago, but I remember when these highways and crossroads pulsed with life. These are the paths I first carried passengers through when I was young.&lt;page&gt;Those travellers are long gone, yet still I remain. Now it seems it&#39;s just you and I and the furtive creatures scratching and squirming all around us.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_EGG_INSPECT">An empty eggshell.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_FUNGUS">Ahh, this gladdens me. The Queen&#39;s Station has opened once more. This place was a bustling hub of travel, well-placed for travellers visiting the outer edges of the land.&lt;page&gt;You&#39;re quite the explorer to find this place.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_HOPE_1">What do you think of my old home, little one?&lt;page&gt;It was full of life, once. Stags coming and going, swapping stories of the places they&#39;d been and the passengers they&#39;d met.&lt;page&gt;For a long time now, I&#39;ve considered myself the only one remaining. The last stag.&lt;page&gt;But being in the Nest again... there&#39;s something in the air. A smell, or a warmth, or a presence perhaps?&lt;page&gt;Could it be, other stags have made their way out into the wider world?</entry>
<entry name="STAG_FLOWER_WARNING">That flower you&#39;re carrying... It looks quite beautiful, but also very delicate. I fear if you travel with me it will be ruined.&lt;page&gt;If you need to keep it intact, I&#39;d suggest using your own legs to carry it to its destination.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_DREAM">I tire so easily now, and my old legs seem to ache more and more. Still, I&#39;m lucky to grow old at all... so many others haven&#39;t.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_REMEMBER_1">You&#39;ve opened several stag stations now, haven&#39;t you? I&#39;m thankful for the opportunity to once more travel through the kingdom.&lt;page&gt;As I visit more places I feel my memories returning to me, like the stagways of my mind are running once more.&lt;page&gt;Continue to open the stations and you&#39;ll have my deepest gratitude.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_REMEMBER_2">Ahh, many stag stations have been opened. Again I can travel the breadth of the kingdom. So many grand thoroughfares and old sideways I&#39;d forgotten.&lt;page&gt;Somewhere amongst the lines lies the Stag Nest, the place where I was born and raised. I&#39;d thought its location lost to my failing mind, but now I can almost remember the path.&lt;page&gt;If you keep opening stag stations and beckoning me through them, perhaps I&#39;ll again find that Nest. Ahh, I would like that very much!</entry>
<entry name="STAG_REMEMBER_3">Little one! I&#39;ve found it! the Stag Nest, where I was born and raised.&lt;page&gt;I&#39;ve yet to go there again. My duty binds me to travel only where I am called, but if you wished to see it yourself, I could take you there.&lt;page&gt;None may remain to welcome us, but the nest is still a sight to behold! Give me the word, and we will go there at once.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_RUINS1">I remember this station well. A common trip it was. Goods from all over the kingdom were transported here.&lt;page&gt;Not a lot was sent back the other way though.</entry>
<entry name="STAG_HIDDEN">Ah! What station is this, hidden all the way at the bottom of the world?&lt;page&gt;Until I heard the bell calling, I didn&#39;t even know the Stagways travelled so deep. You&#39;ve discovered something quite astounding, little one!&lt;page&gt;No matter how old I grow, the world still keeps surprises like this stowed away...</entry>
<entry name="STAG_TISO">I see another takes rest upon the bench. There&#39;s something unpleasant about that one, but a stag station&#39;s doors are open to all.&lt;page&gt;If he requests passage, I&#39;ll offer it gladly. My duty as a stag far outweighs any personal distaste. </entry>
